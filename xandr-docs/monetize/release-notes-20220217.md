# Microsoft Monetize - Enhancements to the ALI setup experience

**Release date**: February 17, 2022

As part of Microsoft Advertising's ongoing effort to make augmented line item setup quicker and more intuitive, we've made several updates to the line item page. These include a more intuitive budgeting workflow, additional IO-level budget allocation details for easy reference, an updated segment targeting component and usability enhancements for the creatives section. For more detailed information, **edit or create an augmented line item** and follow the prompts to check out the updates.
