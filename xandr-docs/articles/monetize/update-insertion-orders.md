# Update Insertion Orders



There are several actions you can take on existing insertion orders to
update them.

Edit an Insertion Order

You can edit an insertion order directly from the
Insertion Orders screen. You can
also edit insertion orders from the
Insertion Order Details screen.
Click either the Edit icon at the top
of the screen or the Edit link in the
Details section. (See
<a href="view-insertion-order-details.html" class="xref"
title="The Insertion Order Details screen displays settings for a specific insertion order, essential metrics, and performance visualizations.">View
Insertion Order Details</a> for more information on the
Details screen.)

Activate/Deactivate an Insertion Order

Check the box next to each insertion order that you want to activate or
deactivate and click Activate or
Deactivate.

Delete an Insertion Order

You can delete insertion orders from the system. This is particularly
useful when you want to get rid of unnecessary or accidentally created
insertion orders.



Warning: Before you delete an insertion
order, make sure that its child line items are associated to other
insertion orders. Otherwise, you will orphan the line items and cause
the line items to stop serving.



On the Insertion Orders screen,
check the box next to each insertion order that you want to delete and
then click Delete.

A confirmation dialog lists the insertion orders that you selected for
deletion. Review the list carefully and then click
OK to permanently delete the insertion
orders from the system.
