# Bid Performance Messages for Augmented Line Items



You can access the Troubleshooting
tab from the Line Item Details
pane to obtain a prioritized list of top bid performance messages. These
messages contain reasons and recommendations for improving your
augmented line item's bid performance. Since these messages are
prioritized by impact significance, you won't see every message
referenced here at once when accessing the
Troubleshooting tab.



For additional information about how to view bid performance messages
for a specific augmented line item (ALI), see <a
