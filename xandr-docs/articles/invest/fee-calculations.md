# Microsoft Invest - Fee calculations

When you create a [partner fee](partner-fees.md), the fee can be based on percentage or CPM. CPM fees are always deducted from revenue. Revshare fees may be calculated in multiple ways:

- Deducted from revenue
- Added to net or gross media cost
- Added to media cost and data cost

Gross media cost includes the [Buyer Auction Service Charge (BASC)](buyer-auction-service-charge-mechanics.md). Net media cost covers only pure media cost.

> Line item currency is inherited from the advertiser. If a fee is created in a currency other than the line item currency, then we will automatically convert the fee to the line item currency at the time of transaction.
