# Domain Targeting







Note: This form of targeting is only
available for Standard Line Items and the campaigns associated with
them. For an overview of which targeting options are available to
Standard versus Augmented Line items, see
<a href="buy-side-targeting.html" class="xref">Buy-Side Targeting</a>.



Domain list targeting is available at the line item or
campaign level, and for campaigns, specific domain targeting is
also available. By default, your line item or
campaign will target impressions from all domains. However, you
can narrow targeting to include or exclude pre-defined domain lists or
specific domains.

Domain targeting applies only to web and mobile web impressions, and
these settings will not be considered for mobile app impressions. If you
don't want to serve on mobile app impressions, turn off the **Apps
Placements** toggle under Device and
Supply Targeting.

Domain list targeting is also limited by any existing domain list
settings in your third-party buying filters at the network level. If
domain lists are included in your third-party buying filters, only those
included domain lists will be available for targeting in your campaign.
If domain lists are excluded in your third-party buying filters, those
excluded domain lists will be unavailable for targeting in your
campaign. To learn more, see

To target domains, domain lists, or a combination of both:





1.  In the
    Targeting section, click
    Edit next to **Inventory**.
    
2.  If you want to target a list of existing
    domains, click the Domains
    Lists tab and include or exclude the relevant lists. 
    

    <div id="ID-00003123__note_iky_swt_lsb" 

    Note: It is not possible to include
    some domain lists and exclude others; all targeted domain lists must
    be either included or excluded. For instructions on adding domain
    lists, see
    <a href="working-with-targeting-lists.html" class="xref">Working with
    Targeting Lists</a>

    

    
3.  For campaigns only: if you want to target a
    specific collection of domains rather than (or as well as) existing
    domain lists, click the Specific
    Domains tab, where you can target up to 25 specific
    domains.
    

    <div id="ID-00003123__note_uqx_w45_lsb" 

    Note: There is an OR relationship,
    not an AND relationship, between included domain lists and included
    individual domains.

    

    

    1.  Enter the domains in a comma-, space-, or
        line-separated list.
    2.  Click Add
        Domains
    3.  Choose whether to include or Exclude the
        domains.

    

    <div id="ID-00003123__note_jvf_z45_lsb" 

    Note: It is not possible to include
    some domains and exclude others. All targeted domains must be either
    included or excluded.
