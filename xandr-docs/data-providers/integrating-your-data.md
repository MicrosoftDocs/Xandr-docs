# Integrating Your Data

<div class="body">

There are several steps to integrating your data. The typical data
provider integration involves the following process:

1.  The data provider and <span class="ph">Xandr</span> enter into an
    agreement consisting of a mutual non-disclosure agreement and a data
    licensing agreement.
2.  <span class="ph">Xandr</span> and the data provider meet to discuss
    and determine the details of the integration between the two
    systems.
3.  The data provider gives <span class="ph">Xandr</span> a business
    development contact. This information is provided to
    <span class="ph">Xandr</span> UI clients in the Help Center within
    <span class="ph">Xandr</span>.
4.  You data is then integrated. This process is determined largely by
    the type of data being integrated. See the following pages for
    details:
