# Insight cards

Monetize Insights automatically identifies issues and opportunities on a periodic basis across a wide range of objects and settings that affect seller monetization. These help Monetize sellers simplify monitoring and optimizing their potential revenue from using the platform.

## Unblock brands

Monetize Insights automatically scans bid rejection data to find brands that are bidding at higher prices on impressions than the transacted revenue but are blocked due to the brand's parent category. These brands are surfaced directly to sellers for review.

This is particularly helpful when Ad Quality rules apply broad category blocks, but specific brands could be considered for exceptions. Sellers can review these insights by previewing the creative to assess its quality against their policy. If acceptable, they can set the brand to **eligible** with a single click in the relevant Ad Quality rule.

- By explicitly setting the brand to **eligible**, the unblocked brand can serve while the general category block remains in place.  
- If the insight is not relevant, the card can be **dismissed**, preventing it from appearing for a period.  
- If the brand should always be hidden from Insights, sellers can **archive** it after dismissal to ensure it never appears again.  
- Sellers can filter insights to view only newly detected brands.  

### FAQ - Unblock brands

**Why do I see more blocked brands due to their category in the Seller Bid Error report?**

The **Seller Bid Error report** provides visibility into all bid rejections, which can help with troubleshooting. However, many bid rejections do not impact revenue because the impression did not transact or the bid was below the transacted revenue.  

Insights focus on **incremental blocked bid value above transacted revenue**, providing a clearer view of bid errors likely to impact revenue.  

**When does the data analysis run?**

Insights are generated **weekly** and are typically available by **9 AM UTC on Mondays**.  

**What is the number of creatives I can preview?**

The insight displays **one** example creative from the brand.  

## Ads.txt

Monetize Insights analyzes **auction filtration logs** to identify impressions filtered due to **ads.txt** and **app-ads.txt**. Insights cards display:  

- The **domain or app**  
- The **operating system family** where the issue is detected  
- The **number of ad requests impacted**

## Deals not spending

Monetize Insights automatically flags active deals that have unexpectedly stopped spending, enabling quick identification and follow-up. Detection runs daily, and newly identified deals are labeled "New" in the UI. A deal will be flagged if:

- The end date has not passed, or there is no end date
- The deal is active and not deleted
- No revenue was recorded in the past 24 hours, but revenue was recorded in at least one of the preceding 7 days


Deals are triaged based on bid funnel metrics data to identify if:
- The deal does not send bid requests
- The deal is sending bid requests but not receiving bids
- The deal is receiving bids but not transacting

To investigate the issue, click a flagged deal to see other deals with the same issue in the bid funnel such as "Deals receiving bids, but no impressions sold". Each deal listed displays the following::

- Last revenue date
- Total revenue transacted in the deal over the past 7 days
- Pressing Investigate to pull 24-hour data from the [Seller Deal Metrics](seller-deal-metrics.md) report, to identify:
    - Most recent impressions matched
    - Bid requests sent
    - Bid rate
    - Ineligible bid rate
    - Net win rate

For deeper analysis:
- Navigate directly into reporting
- Download a bid request (if the deal is with an external DSP) and share with buyers to troubleshoot bid submission issues.
