# View order information for a specific parent product

By default, the **Orders Dashboard** page displays at-risk impressions, consumed impressions, and order performance for your entire network. However, you can view them for a specified parent product.

1. At the top of the **Orders Dashboard** page, select **Analyzed Network**.
1. In the **Parent Product Filter** dialog that appears, select the parent product for the order, or type in the box to find a specific product.
1. Select **Update**.

To reset the **Orders Dashboard** to your entire analyzed network, enter **Analyzed Network** in the **Parent Product Filter** dialog.
