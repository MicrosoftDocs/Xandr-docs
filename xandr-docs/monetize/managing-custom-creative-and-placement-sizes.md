# Managing custom creative and placement sizes

You can define custom dimensions and use those sizes when you [Working with Creatives](working-with-creatives.md) or [placements](working-with-placements.md) to the system. These size dimensions are applicable in numerous locations throughout Microsoft Monetize. You can also indicate whether a size is standard or non-standard, which allows you to categorize the sizes as needed throughout the user interface.

On the **Custom Sizes** screen, you can perform the following tasks:

- Define a new creative/placement size

- Indicate whether a creative/placement size is designated as **standard** or **non-standard**
- Delete a creative/placement size
