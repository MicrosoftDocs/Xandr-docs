# Location manager

**Location Manager** is located under the **Audiences** tab in
Curate. You can create and manage location-based
features such as Geo Radius Segments and Postal Code Lists with the
**Location Manager**.

- **Geo radius segments**: A geo radius segment is a list of latitude,
  longitude, and radius data. You can use geo radius segments for
  geographical targeting of multiple user locations. For more
  information about how to create and manage geo radius segments, see [Geo Radius Segments](geo-radius-segments.md).
- **Postal Code Lists**: A postal code list is a list of postal codes of
  a country which can be used to target at line item and split levels.
  For more information about how to create and manage postal code lists,
