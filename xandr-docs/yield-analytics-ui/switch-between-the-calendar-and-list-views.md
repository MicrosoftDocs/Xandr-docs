# Switch between the calendar and list views

The **View Calendar** page can be displayed in two views:

- A calendar view that shows a graphical high-level overview of each day on the selected month's calendar.
- A list view that shows the month in a table where each row can be expanded to drill down for detailed information for a given day.

To switch from the calendar view (default) to the list view, click on the calendar toolbar.

To switch from the list view to the calendar view, click on the calendar toolbar.
