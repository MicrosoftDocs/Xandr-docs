Occasionally, publishers pass the age or gender of users in the query
string of their ad calls. In these cases, you can target users based on
this information.

> [!WARNING]
> User age and gender are passed for a small portion of impressions. Targeting specific age groups and/or genders will drastically limit reach.

1. In the Demographics section in the
    **Audience & Location Targeting**
    section of the augmented line item, click the pencil icon next to
    **Demographics**. (For a standard line item or
    campaign, this setting is located in the
    Targeting settings.)
1. By default, any age or gender is targeted. For **Age**, you can
    narrow your targeting to only specific preset age ranges, or you can
    define custom age ranges.
1. For **Gender**, you can narrow your targeting to one gender or the
    other.

> [!TIP]
> If you target specific ages or a specific gender, you should consider selecting **Allow unknown age** or **Allow unknown gender** as well to avoid severely restricting reach.
