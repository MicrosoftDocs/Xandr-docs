# Add a transition animation on Android

The transition animation feature is disabled by default. To enable banner ad transition animations, implement the following code:

```
bav.setTransitionType(TransitionType.PUSH);
```

You can disable banner transitions by calling:

```
bav.setTransitionType(TransitionType.NONE);
```

The available transition types (including `NONE` to disable the feature) are:

- none
- random
- push
- reveal
- move in
- fade

In addition to its type, a transition animation has a direction and a duration (expressed in milliseconds) associated with it. Set the direction and duration of transition animations like so:

```
bav.setTransitionDirection(TransitionDirection.UP);  // or DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT
bav.setTransitionDuration( 1000 );
```

The default values for the direction and duration are `UP` and `1000`, respectively.
