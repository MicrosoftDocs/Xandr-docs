# Microsoft Invest - In-Market audiences

Microsoft In-market Audiences are curated lists of users determined to be in market and ready to buy within a particular category. These segments are based on Microsoftâ€™s unique intent signals, including search on Bing and user activity on Microsoft solutions. The power of search behavior indicates that the audiences have a high probability of conversion.

In-market Audiences are global, and available in more than 90 markets. Take a look at this [up-to-date list](https://download.microsoft.com/download/4/0/0/40099106-6f9f-4b38-8aac-0dc7567404db/In-Market-Audiences-segment-list-Invest.xlsx) for all the available in-market audience segments.

## Special considerations for Microsoft In-Market audiences

Due to the proprietary nature of this data, there will be a set of data protections applied to line items when targeting Microsoft In-Market Audiences.

| Area of Impact | Description of Impact |
|:---|:---|
| Creative | - Creatives must be hosted, non-HTML5. <br> - Third-party pixels are restricted as follows: <br> - Image URL and Raw URL pixel types are supported and fired server-side. **Note**: Server-side firing may result in reporting inconsistencies, as the calls come from a server rather than a user's browser/device. <br> - IAS JavaScript pixels are now supported on banner and video creatives. <br> - Other HTML URL, JavaScript URL and Raw JavaScript pixel types will be blocked at auction time. <br> - Certain creative macros will be blocked at auction time (see list of LLD restricted fields below). <br> - Segment pixels will be blocked at auction time. |

To utilize this feature, apply your IAS JavaScript pixels to the hosted banner and video creatives you wish to run. Advertiser and member-level pixels are also compatible. If your IAS pixels are already configured, no further action is required! <br><br> **Note**: Support for IAS viewability/verification for video and native creatives will be available soon. <br><br> No other measurement integrations are currently supported when using Microsoft Audiences. |
