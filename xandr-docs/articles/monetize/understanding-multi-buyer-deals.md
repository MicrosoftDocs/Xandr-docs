# Understanding Multi-Buyer Deals



Multi-Buyer Deals provides sellers with two different ways to set up
deals with multiple buyers.

>

Multi-buyer deals offer the following benefits to sellers:

- Sellers can set up a deal with multiple buyers. When sellers set up a
  deal, they can include a list of buyers rather than just one. Buyers
  encompass seats or members as well as entire DSPs. When a seller sets
  up a deal with eligible buyers on a DSP, they use the DSP’s bidder ID
  (not a proxy member ID of any kind).
- Sellers can edit the buyers on a deal. Once a seller configures a
  deal, they can edit who the buyers are over the course of a deal.
  

  <b>Note:</b> Some DSPs do not support
  changing the buyers once a deal has been registered on the DSP. Be
  sure to check with the buyer about what they support.

  
- Sellers can better understand how DSPs are configured to buy on deals.
  The Buyer Targeting screen (see

  title="You can set up Multi-Buyer Deals in two different ways: 1) multi-buyer deals with multiple buyers across various DSPs and 2) bidder-level deals with all buyers on a DSP.">Set
  Up Multi-Buyer Deals</a>) indicates whether a DSP is bidding with
  seats or members and it will enforce settings around whether that DSP
  supports multi-buyer or bidder-level deals.
  Xandr enables DSPs on an individual basis to
  support either bidder-level (i.e., DSP-wide) or multi-buyer deals.





With multi-buyer deals, sellers can set up:

- Multi-buyer deals with multiple buyers (members or seats) across
  various DSPs. There’s no limit on the number of buyers that can be
  included on a deal.
- Bidder-level deals with all buyers in a multi-buyer enabled DSP.

<b>Note:</b> Each DSP has different levels of
support for these features. A DSP might support both, only one, or
neither of these options.
