# Advertiser User Reporting



<div id="ID-0000331f__section-6fc8f129-bc5b-4fa8-93ea-9bbc00e877de"

If you have created separate
<a href="managing-user-logins-and-permissions.md" class="xref">user
login</a> for your advertisers, they will be able to run reports from
their perspective. These advertiser users have a limited set of metrics,
filters, and dimensions available to them. This allows you to give your
clients access to reporting while protecting your proprietary business
data.

For instructions on how to give advertiser users access to reporting,
see <a href="create-a-user.md" class="xref">Create a User</a>.



<b>Important:</b>

Conversion-related data in reports is processed asynchronously. As a
result, reports are available more quickly, while some
conversion-related data is still being processed in the background. For
more information, see
<a href="availability-of-reporting-data.md" class="xref">Availability
of Reporting Data</a>.





<b>Important:</b> The **Metrics** are shown
