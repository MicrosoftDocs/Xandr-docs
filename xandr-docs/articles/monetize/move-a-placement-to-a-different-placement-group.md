# Move a Placement to a Different Placement Group



A placement is an open slot on a publisher website where an advertiser
creative with matching specifications can serve. Placement groups
provide a way for you to organize and manage placements apply default
inventory categorization and self-auditing criteria to child placements.
This page explains how to move a placement to a new placement group.

**Publisher-only clients:** Select
Placements from the
**Inventory** menu in the main
navigation menu, then select the publisher you want to work with from
the Select a Publisher dialog.

**All other clients:** Go to
Publishers
 \>  Placement Manager.
This takes you to the Placement
Manager screen, which shows both the **Placement Group List** and
the **Placement List** under each placement group for the publisher.

2\. Move the desired placements to a different placement group

Check the checkbox for the placement under which you want to move to
another new placement group, then click
More Actions
 \>  Move. This will
open the **Select a destination placement group** dialog. Click
Select to complete the action. If you
want to move more than one placement to the same group, you can move
them all at once by checking multiple boxes.

In the **Placement Group List,** click the placement group under which
you moved the placement. You should see the placements you moved show up
in the **Placement List** for that placement group.
