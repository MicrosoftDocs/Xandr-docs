# Microsoft Curate - Switch between user accounts

This will instruct you how to use the account switcher to switch between user accounts.

Once signed in, you are assigned to your default account. To switch between user accounts, you must select the user account you wish to switch into from the **account switcher**.

This task explains how you can switch from one user account to another after you log in.

1. Launch the **account switcher** by selecting the **member name** in the upper-right corner of the application.

1. Select the **Switch Member** button. This action will list all the accounts that you have access to.

1. Select any other row of the list to switch to that user account. The system will take care of authenticating you and redirecting you to the new account without logging out and logging back in.

1. You can set a default account by selecting **Set as Default** after selecting that account. If you set up a default account, every time you log in to the system, you are assigned to your default account. It doesnâ€™t matter which account you were in last. It will always return to the default account every time you log in again. Also, you can change the default account whenever you want by selecting **Set as Default**.

1. You can set your most used accounts as **favorite** on the leftmost side of the screen so that they appear at the top of the list. This is especially helpful if you have a large amount of user accounts.
