# Microsoft Invest - Managing user logins and permissions

The pages mentioned in this section describe how to create and manage your users, set up their passwords and permissions.

With consolidation of Xandr to Microsoft family, we have integrated the authentication process of the users (who are using Xandr products) to the Microsoft Identity Platform. The profound advantage of this integration is that users would be able use to access Xandr applications using the same sign-on methods to access other Microsoft products. Additionally, the integration to the Microsoft Identity Platform enables new and more secure methods of authentication, powered by Microsoft.

For more details, see [Microsoft Identity Platform Login](microsoft-identity-platform-login.md).
