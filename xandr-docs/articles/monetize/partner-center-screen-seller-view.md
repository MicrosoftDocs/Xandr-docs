# Partner Center Screen - Seller View



On the Partner Center screen you can
view your partners, search all buyers, manage your profile, manage your
default buyer settings, and review impression and click statistics for
each buyer.

Getting to the Partner Center Screen

**Publisher clients:** Select
Marketplace
 \>  Partner Center.

**All other clients:** Select
Partners
\>  Partner Center.

Switching to Buyers Mode

If you are a network that also represents buyers, the
Buyers and
Sellers tabs display. Click
Buyers to view the
Partner Center as a seller looking for
buyers.

Managing Your Profile

Click the My Profile button to edit
the information that demand partners will see on your Partner Details
page. Your profile provides information about your company which helps
demand partners understand how you could be useful as a partner. The
My Seller Profile dialog also displays
an overview of the audit quality of your inventory. You can see how much
of your inventory has been self-audited
(Seller-reviewed) and how much has
been audited by Xandr
(Platform-reviewed).

For step-by-step instructions on customizing your profile, see
<a href="customize-your-seller-profile.md" class="xref">Customize Your
Seller Profile</a>.

Setting Buyer Defaults

You can establish default buyer eligibility, allowed payment types, and
targeting access settings for all demand partners within the
Default Settings dialog.

For step-by-step instructions on setting your default settings, see <a
href="set-default-buyer-eligibility-allowed-payment-types-and-targeting-access.md"
class="xref">Set Default Buyer Eligibility, Allowed Payment Types, and
Targeting Access</a> .

It is possible to override these settings for individual demand
partners. For details, see <a
href="edit-buyer-eligibility-allowed-payment-types-and-targeting-access.md"
class="xref">Edit Buyer Eligibility, Allowed Payment Types, and
Targeting Access</a>.

Setting default buyer eligibility

- Eligible - You can sell inventory to
  this partner, since the ads they would like to serve have proven
  trustworthy (i.e., this partner's ads meet your ad quality
  requirements). If you select this, you must define the payment methods
  you will accept and the targeting information you will provide. See
  the <a
  href="partner-center-screen-seller-view.md#ID-00000600__ID-00000651"
  class="xref">Setting default allowed payment types</a> and <a
  href="partner-center-screen-seller-view.md#ID-00000600__ID-0000065b"
  class="xref">Setting default targeting access</a> sections (below).

- Blocked - You will **not** sell any
  inventory to this member for any number of reasons. For example, you
  may have a direct relationship with a buyer, and you wish to avoid
  allowing them access to your inventory at a potentially lower price
  via RTB.

  This setting is similar to banning or trusting members in
  <a href="working-with-publisher-ad-quality.md" class="xref">Working
  with Ad Quality</a>. If you ban a buyer there or in Partner Center,
  that member will be banned. A member does not need to be banned in
  both places.

Setting default allowed payment types

This indicates the types of payment you accept from eligible partners.

If you allow CPC and CPA payment, you must also set up publishers to
accept CPC and CPA payment types as described in
<a href="create-a-publisher.md" class="xref">Create a Publisher</a>.

For more information, see
<a href="cpc-and-cpa-payment-types.md" class="xref">CPC and CPA
Payment Types</a>.

Setting default targeting access

This indicates the information each member receives when targeting your
inventory. Members cannot report on this information; it is only used
for targeting. The more information you give buyers, the more easily
they can target your inventory.

- URLs - Expose your domains to allow
  members using allowlists to more easily target your inventory. (You
  will have the option to expose domains or full URLs to some external
  buyers.)
- Category (Universal) - Expose
  information you provide to allow the buyer to target via universal
  categories. For more information on assigning categories when creating
  a placement, see
  <a href="create-a-placement.md" class="xref">Create a Placement</a>.
- Category (Custom) - Expose custom
  categories to grant the buyer the ability to target customized slices
  of inventory that you have collected into a category.
  For more information on adding a placement to a
  custom category, see
  <a href="create-a-placement.md" class="xref">Create a Placement</a>.
- Age - Expose information you provide
  to allow the buyer to target via age. For more
  information on using an age macro when exporting your placement, see
  <a href="placement-tag-parameters.md" class="xref">Placement Tag
  Parameters</a>.
- Gender - Expose information you
  provide to allow the buyer to target via gender. For
  more information on using a gender macro when exporting your
  placement, see
  <a href="placement-tag-parameters.md" class="xref">Placement Tag
  Parameters</a>.
- Placements - Expose the placement
  name to allow the buyer to more easily target a specific placement.
- Publishers - Expose a publisher's
  name and ID to allow the buyer to more easily target a specific
  publisher.

Viewing Buyers

The Buyers tab will list all buyers,
both Monetize members and external bidders. Each
buyer's member name and ID will display along with statistics. The
statistics reflect your transactions with the buyer over the time period
indicated in the Show Transactions
From drop-down. Search for buyers (see the <a
href="partner-center-screen-seller-view.md#ID-00000600__ID-00000693"
class="xref">Searching for buyers</a> section) to find a specific type
of buyer and then review the statistics to determine if you'd like to
partner with the buyer.

Transactions with Buyer

- Imps  - Number of impressions that
  the buyer has purchased from you.
- Clicks - Number of clicks that were
  generated from inventory that was purchased from you.
- CTR - Buyer's click-through rate on
  your inventory.
- Revenue - Amount of revenue that you
  earned from the buyer.
- Profit - Amount of profit that you
  earned from the buyer, calculated by subtracting media cost from
  revenue.

Searching for Buyers

Use the filters to search the Buyers
list for a buyer that meets your partnership needs. You can filter the
list of buyers by:

- Name/ID - A specific buyer's name or
  member ID.

- Primary Market - The country in
  which the buyer purchased 50% or more of their total RTB impressions.
  Buyers who do not purchase 50% or more in a single country will not
  have a primary market.

- Buyer Eligibility - Eligibility
  settings you have defined for buyers.

- Allowed Payment Types - Payment
  types you have allowed for buyers. Select
  Any Type to search for buyers from
  whom you accept any of the payment types you have checked. Or, select
  CPM Only to search for buyers from
  whom you only accept CPM payment.

- Targeting Access - Targeting access
  you have exposed to buyers.

  Click the Hide Search Filters "**\<**" icon to collapse the section
  and provide more viewing space for your partner lists.

Viewing Partnership Details

Click on a buyer's name to view the Partner Details screen for that
buyer. You can then review and manage your relationship with the buyer,
view spending trends, and access any active or upcoming deals.
