# Save and share a report

Reports must be saved to be shared with other people.

1. Create a new report or open an existing one.
1. On the toolbar, click **Save**. The **Save Analysis** dialog appears.
1. Select either **Save as New** or **Replace Existing** report.
1. Enter the report **Name**, **Description**, and **Category** as needed.
    - When naming the report, consider your company's naming conventions and remember that report names are used for searching.
    - To add a new report category, click **Add New** to the right of the **Category** dropdown list.
1. (Optional) To make this report your default report, select the **Set as default** checkbox.
1. To share the report with users in other groups, click the **click here** link. Then select the group(s) from the list that appears.
1. Click **Save**.

If you're sharing the report with someone who doesn't have access to yield analytics, the recipient doesn't receive a URL to access the report.
