# Microsoft Curate - Curator supply shaping

## Overview

> [!NOTE]
> To use Supply Shaping, please contact your Microsoft Advertising account representative.

When you make a curated deal, you configure the inventory and the audiences you wish to target. When the Microsoft Advertising platform receives an ad call, if your curated deal’s targeting criteria are met, your curated deal is added to the auction and sent to the buyer so they can bid on it.

By default, your curated deal behaves the same way for every ad call:

- If the targeting criteria are met, the deal is added to the auction.
- If you’ve configured a floor or margin on your curated deal, these settings are used in the auction.

There are scenarios where you might want your curated deal to behave differently for certain ad calls. For example:

- Certain tranches of inventory or certain audience segments might be driving better performance for your buyer’s campaign. If you take a margin, you might want to reduce it on these tranches or segments to drive more delivery.  
- Alternatively, to further drive delivery on inventory and audiences performing well for your buyer, you might wish to send them different bidding guidance by using a higher floor price.  
- Certain publishers might be sending a larger volume of ad calls than others, meaning they have a larger representation within the curated deal’s delivery. For certain publishers, even if they meet the curated deal’s targeting criteria, you might want to curate only a portion of their auctions to ensure a more even representation across publishers.

**Supply Shaping** is designed to help with these scenarios. It allows you to create splits to target inventory and audiences in a granular fashion and define custom margins, floors, and spend allocations for each split.
