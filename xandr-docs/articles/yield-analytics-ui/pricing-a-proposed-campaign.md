# Pricing a Proposed Campaign



Unlike consumption data (which comes directly from ad server logs),
working with pricing requires more diligence on the part of the
publisher. This is to ensure their revenue data in yield analytics  
is correct, since that data relies on manual input. Many times,
publishers input contracted revenue as their rate, or input SOV as the
impression goal. Both of these create extreme outliers (in terms of eCPM
data) and can misrepresent the truth.  Once you feel confident in
the quality of your
revenue data, you can extract valuable pricing insights with the following
path.

**High Level Path**:

 Use reporting to pull a view on the products you are
looking to price, and set the baseline context for comparison. Do you
want to look at pricing in the context of a particular timeframe,
industry, agency, advertiser, or contract type?

 Compare your proposal to the historical or future baseline you’ve set.
From this point, it’s up to you and your own internal
business rules on when you choose to intervene and adjust the pricing.

**Detailed Path**:

-  Typically, two primary dimensions in yield analytics are helpful when
  working with pricing: product and sold as product. ‘Product’
  dimensioning (product is an ad server concept) will let you
  understand yield based on how your inventory is consumed, regardless
  of how you sold it. In comparison, ‘sold as product’ (which is an
  order management concept) will let you understand yield based on how
  your inventory is sold, regardless of how you consume it. Most of the
  time, publishers simply use ‘sold as product’ dimensioning, since that
  is easier to map to how a plan is proposed.
- The view that is most common is to set sold as product as the primary
  dimension, earned revenue as the primary metric, and then add consumed
  impressions and eCPM as additional metrics. This will give you a sense
  of how much is being sold, how much is being earned, and at what
  price - based on how a customer actually buys. You can then filter
  down to a particular advertiser, industry, agency, contract type, and
  various timeframes to set the right context for your analysis. If you
  provide preferential rates to a particular advertiser for example, it
  may not be helpful to look at your overall average, but rather
  that specific advertiser’s historical rates. Similarly, if your demand
  (and therefore pricing power) is radically different from quarter to
  quarter, you may want to look at that quarter’s historical
  rates, rather than your annual average.
-  You can also filter to just
  the specific sold as products you need, or export the entire view to
  Excel, where you may find the data easier to work with than the UI.
-  When to intervene in a proposal’s pricing is really up to you the
  publisher, and your internal business rules.
