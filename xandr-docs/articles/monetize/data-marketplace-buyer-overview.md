# Microsoft Monetize - Data Marketplace (Buyer Overview)

Xandr supports automatic clearing for data you
purchase on our platform and use to target particular user segments.
This means that the costs of these user segments will be:

- Displayed when the segment is selected during targeting.
- Aggregated and totaled on the relevant items as well as appear in the
  relevant reports.
- Bundled into your invoice totals and represented as an aggregated data
  cost.

In addition:

- "Total cost" is the sum of your Media cost plus any Third-party data
  costs (e.g., segments purchased from Data Providers).
- Media cost is just the cost of buying the actual media (impression).
- Third-party data costs are the aggregated costs of all third-party
  services and data used in purchasing that media (e.g., user segments,
  etc.).

> [!NOTE]
> The cost of any segments for which the data provider did not provide a price is not currently reflected in the aggregate cleared totals. You will be billed separately by the Data Provider for the cost of those segments.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For information regarding how each data provider charges for multiple segment usage, please contact your data provider or Xandr representative Please note that when multiple data providers are used, Xandr will charge the buyer the sum of all data provider charges.
>
> Data rates are not inclusive of applicable sales, use, gross receipts, excise, goods and services, value added, and other transaction-based taxes. Such applicable taxes will be reflected when your data costs are calculated. 

If a Data Provider you use is not on this list, contact your
Xandr Account/Engagement Manager.

## Workflow

The procedures in this section explain how to enable the clearing of
data provider costs. This results in distinction being made between
Media costs and Data costs (e.g., for user segments, etc.).

### Add data providers

To access a particular data provider's segment offering:

1. Navigate to the **Segments**
    screen
    (**Network**
    \>  **Segments** \>
     **Segment Manager**).
1. Click **Manage Data Providers**. If
    you don't see this option, contact your Account Manager.
1. Select the data providers for whom you want the data cost to be
    cleared directly by Xandr. Each activated
    data provider (whose data cost will be cleared by
    Xandr) will appear checked and highlighted.

> [!NOTE]
> If you ever choose to deactivate a data provider, you must first remove all active targeting of their segments. Once you have removed any targeting that is using these segments, log in to the [Customer Support Portal](https://help.xandr.com/s/login/)9 and create a ticket to complete the deactivation.

### Determining if a segment will be cleared within the data marketplace

- If the **Price** column in the
  **Segment Manager/Segment Chooser** lists a value for the segment,
  that segment will be cleared as part of the
  AppNexus Data Marketplace.
- If **--** is displayed in the
  **Price** column in the **Segment
  Manager** next to a segment, that segment is not supported by the
  AppNexus Data Marketplace. For these
  unsupported segments, you will be billed separated by the data
  provider if you use that segment to target an audience.

### Setting segment targeting

1. When selecting targeting options on the line item
    or campaign, if you select the
    **Edit** button next to
    **Segment** under
    **Targeting**, the
    **Segments** page will be
    displayed.
1. The available segments (along with prices, when available) will then
    be displayed on the **Segments**
    screen.
1. You can select the various segments that you wish to include in or
    exclude from your targeting. To calculate the total costs of all
    segments selected, click **Calculate Data Cost**.

When creating or editing line items, if you select
**Cost Plus** as your **Revenue Tracking
Type**, the labelling will now show **Total Cost** instead of Media
Cost.

> [!NOTE]
> For any costs for which the yellow alert symbol is displayed, Xandr will not clear. These alerts denote one of the following conditions:
>
> For segments:
> - you have selected a segment for which the Data Provider has not supplied a price
> - you have selected a segment from a Data Provider who is not participating in Xandr automating clearing
> - you have selected a user-created segment (e.g., generated via a pixel) not supplied by a Data Provider
> 
> For Data Cost Totals:
>
> - one or more of the segments you selected fit the conditions listed above for segment alerts

## Data usage in reports

### Data usage report (API)

For details on the API version of this report, see the [Data Usage Report](../digital-platform-api/data-usage-report.md). Free segments will
not be appears in data usage reports.

### Data usage report (UI)

For details on the UI version of this report,
see the [Data Usage Report](../digital-platform-api/data-usage-report.md).
Free segments will not be appears in data usage reports.

### Network analytics report (API)

The `data_costs` field in the `network_analytics` report contains the
sum of all third-party data costs. For details on these data costs, see
[Data Usage Report](../digital-platform-api/data-usage-report.md). In addition, the
`revenue` field in the `network_analytics` report includes all
third-party data costs in totals when the Line Item's `revenue_type` is
set to `cost_plus_cpm` or `cost_plus_margin`.

### Network analytics report (UI)

The **Data Costs** field in the
**Network Analytics** report contains the sum of
all third-party data costs. For details on these data costs, see
[Data Usage Report](../digital-platform-api/data-usage-report.md). In
addition, the **Revenue** field in the
**Network Analytics** reports also includes all third-party data costs
in totals when the Line Item's **Revenue
Type** is set to "Cost Plus" (with either a "Margin" or flat "CPM"
value).

### Data usage in invoices

Your invoices contain the **Cost of Data** row. This row is a sum of all
third-party data costs incurred for that month. To verify that these
invoice values are accurate, compare them to the data in your
[Data Usage Report](../digital-platform-api/data-usage-report.md). For
more details on invoices, see [Understanding Your Invoice](understanding-your-invoice.md).

### Setting data costs to display in grid views

To set your Insertion Order or Line Item grid views to display your
third-party data costs, click on the column settings button (for each
object) and select **Third-party Costs**
on the **Configure Columns** screen that
appears.

As a result of selecting this option, the aggregated totals of all
third-party data costs will appear within your grid views.

### Data cost metric on the Insertion Order grid view

An aggregated total of all third-party data costs incurred as a result
of the use of third-party services or data (e.g., data segments, etc.)
will be displayed on your insertion orders. This value represents the
total of all third-party data costs associated with any
line item or campaign under the insertion order.

> [!NOTE]
> The cost of any segments for which the data provider did not provide a price is not currently reflected in the aggregate cleared totals. You will be billed separately by the Data Provider for the cost of those segments.

An aggregated total of all third-party data costs incurred as a result
of the use of third-party services or data (e.g., data segments, etc.)
will be displayed on your line items. This value represents the total of
all third-party data costs.

> [!NOTE]
> The cost of any segments for which the data provider did not provide a price is not currently reflected in the aggregate cleared totals. You will be billed separately by the Data Provider for the cost of those segments.

### Data cost calculation mechanics

A buyer will only be charged for a segment if that segment is used in a
winning bid for an impression. Whether the buyer is charged for the
segment is further determined by the AND/OR boolean logic that the buyer
has selected.

The following diagram illustrates this process. In this process, a
relevant segment is a segment that has a match with one or more
parameters within an ad request. If a line item or
campaign is targeting 3rd party segments and there are no
relevant segments then no bid is made. A used segment is a segment that
is used to bid in the auction. The difference between a relevant segment
and a used segment is that not all relevant segments are required to be
used for a line item or campaign to bid in the
auction. Note that many other factors besides segment targeting
influence the decision on whether a bid is made on an impression in the
auction such as inventory or geo targeting.

Key steps in assessing data cost:

1. A list of relevant segments is provided in the bid request

1. Used segments are determined based upon the segments which caused
    Microsoft Monetize to submit a bid. The list of
    relevant segments, the buyer's targeted segments and boolean AND/OR
    decisioning logic the buyer has selected are all determining
    factors.

1. The auction is run and the impression is won by the
    line item or campaign (see [Win the Auction](#win-the-auction)).

1. Data costs for used segments are determined based on each data
    provider's rate cards and pricing rules.

    The examples below illustrate in more detail how this general
    process works.

## How costs are incurred for selected segments

> [!NOTE]
> In the examples below, a green box indicates a relevant segment for a single impression, a red box indicates that it is not a relevant segment for a single impression.

### Single segment targeted

In the simplest scenario, the line item or
campaign is targeting just a single segment. The presence of the
user's unique identifier (a parameter in the auction) determines whether
the demographic segment is relevant. For line item or
campaign targeting one segment if a segment is relevant, then the
segment will be used to bid in the auction.

:::image type="content" source="media/basic.png" alt-text="Screenshot of basic .":::

### Multiple segments targeted

If multiple segments are targeted with a line item or
campaign, the boolean AND/ OR logic that the buyer has selected
will determine whether the ad request matches the required targeting
criteria.

- If the segments are ANDed, only an ad request that is relevant to ALL
  segments will generate a bid.
- If the the segments are ORed, an ad request that is relevant to ANY of
  the targeted segments will generate a bid.

**When the segments are targeted using the AND boolean**

- If the ad request is relevant in ALL targeted segments, a bid will be
  made.

:::image type="content" source="media/advanced-and-a.png" alt-text="Screenshot of advanced AND 1 .":::

- If the ad request is not relevant to one or many of the targeted
  segments, then no bid will be made
:::image type="content" source="media/advanced-and-b.png" alt-text="Screenshot of advanced AND 2":::
 
:::image type="content" source="media/advanced-and-c.png" alt-text="Screenhot of advanced AND 3":::
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > Since the ad request is required to be relevant for ALL targeted segments using the AND boolean, the buyer will be charged for the use of ALL segments if the impression is won.


**When the segments are targeted using the OR boolean**

- If the ad request is relevant to ANY segment, a bid will be made using
  the relevant segment.

:::image type="content" source="media/advanced-or-a.png" alt-text="Screenshot of advanced OR 1 .":::

:::image type="content" source="media/advanced-or-b.png" alt-text="Diagram of advanced OR 2 .":::

 - If the ad request is relevant to more than one segment (overlaps),
  Xandr will use the lowest priced segment to
  bid on the auction.

:::image type="content" source="media/advanced-or-c.png" alt-text="Diagram of advanced OR 3 .":::

- If the ad request is NOT relevant to any targeted segment, then no bid
  will be made.

:::image type="content" source="media/advanced-or-d.png" alt-text="Diagram of advanced OR 4 .":::

### Multiple groups of segments targeted

Buyers can create multiple segments groups (using the boolean AND/OR
operators described above) and those groups can apply either the AND or
OR boolean operator. The same process described above is used to
determine whether a bid is made. However, due to the complexity of the
tiering of boolean operations (e.g., an AND within an ORed group) the
calculation needs to be performed multiple times to determine whether
the line item or campaign bids in the auction or
not.

**AND Targeting using Segment Groups**

:::image type="content" source="media/advanced-and-d.png" alt-text="Screenshot of advanced AND 5":::

When using the AND boolean against segment groups, the boolean within
each group will be set to OR. OR pricing logic described in the section
above will be used to determine which segments to use in each group.
Then a second calculation is done to verify that at least one segment is
relevant in each group. At least one segment from each group will be
used to bid on the auction.

**When the segment groups have been ORed**

:::image type="content" source="media/advanced-or.png" alt-text="Screenshot of advanced OR 4":::

When using the OR boolean against segment groups, the boolean within
each group will be set to AND. As such, each segment group will be
evaluated using the AND pricing logic described in the section above to
calculate the prices for each group. Then a second calculation is done
to evaluate each group using the OR pricing logic described above. All
segments within one segment group will be used to bid on the auction.

**When the segments are negatively targeted (exclusion targeting)**

- If a parameter in the ad request is included in the negatively
  targeted segment, then no bid is made.
- <span id="ID-000086c8__ID-00008a6e">If a parameter in the ad request
  is not included in the negatively targeted segment, then a bid is
  made.

### Win the auction

Data costs are only charged on impressions that are won by the
line item or campaign.

**When the segments are positively targeted (inclusion targeting)**

The buyer will be charged for all segments that were used to win the
bid. The group of used segments will be passed through the data
provider's pricing methodology as described in the provider's rate cards
to determine a bundled price. Contact your Xandr
representative or data provider for segment pricing information.

**When the segments are negatively targeted (exclusion targeting)**

The buyer will be charged for exclusion targeted segments when an
impression is won. For further clarity, this means that the buyer will
be charged when parameters for an ad request does not belong to the
segment.

## FAQs

**What happens when I activate a data provider?**

Xandr will automatically set up standard pricing
for that data provider and shares all public segments to your seat. You
will be able to immediately start targeting that data provider's
segments.

**Does the data marketplace support custom segments?**

Yes, we provide the same reporting and clearing services for custom
segments if the data provider has opted to offer them through our data
marketplace. Once the data provider has been activated in
the UI, the data provider will be able to expose
your custom segments to your Xandr account. You
will know everything is properly set up when the segment is available
for targeting and there is a price associated with the segment.

**What if I have better rates than what Xandr provides?**

We support custom rate cards that are CPM or % of media cost based. We
currently do not support tiered, or flat rate models.

**What if I have a monthly flat-rate deal with a data provider?**

Xandr will not be able to clear that cost for
the buyer. The data provider will have to continue invoicing your
organization directly.

**Do you support custom rate cards in non-USD currencies?**

Yes, we support all currencies listed in our
[Currency Support](currency-support.md) documentation.

**How will this look on my invoice?**

In most cases, the cost of data will be an extra line item in your
invoice. If you receive invoices in a non-USD currency, the cost of data
will be invoiced in the same currency as your cost of media. The invoice
will not be broken out by data provider. However, we provide a data
usage report for that level of granularity.

**Do I have to change anything about my line item or campaign to make this work?**

If your in-flight line item or campaign is
targeting a segment supported by the data marketplace, then there is
nothing on the line item or campaign that you
have to change. Once the data provider is activated for clearing,
Xandr will immediately start clearing the cost
of data on your behalf.

**The data provider I need isn't supported by the Data Marketplace. What should I do?**

Data provider requests can be submitted to
[data-marketplace-request@appnexus.com](mailto:data-marketplace-request@appnexus.com)

**I am having issues with the data marketplace features. How can I get support?**

Submit a support ticket via our
[Customer Support Portal](https://help.xandr.com/s/login/) and our team will provide assistance shortly.

## Glossary

- **Segments** - Segments available through the Data Marketplace
- **Relevant Segment** - A segment (targeted by the buyer) that matches
  against one or more parameters of the ad request. A relevant segment
  is eligible for being used by Xandr to bid.
- **Used Segment** - A segment that is used by
  Xandr to bid on the auction. If the
  line item or campaign wins the auction, then
  all used segments will be charged to the buyer. The segment(s) used
  for each auction is determined by Xandr.
- **Bundled Price** - The price for a group of segments determined by
  the data provider via their chosen pricing methodology.
- **Exclusion Targeted Segment** - A segment that is negatively targeted
  by the buyer. The buyer is choosing not to bid on auctions where one
  or more parameters of the ad request fall into an exclusion targeted
  segment.
