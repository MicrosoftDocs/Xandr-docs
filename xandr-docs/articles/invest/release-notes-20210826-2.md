# August 26, 2021: Cross device for Europe - Invest changes

On August 30, 2021, Tapad cross-device targeting for Europe will officially end in Microsoft Invest. To continue utilizing cross-device targeting for Europe on our Microsoft Invest platform: switch to the Xandr (US + EU) graph. These new options will be available on August 26, 2021. On August 30, 2021 Tapad cross-device targeting will be removed from line items in the EU. The line items will continue to run, but will no longer conduct cross-device targeting.
