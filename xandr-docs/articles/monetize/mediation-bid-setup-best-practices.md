There are a number of factors to keep in mind when you're setting up
bids. This page attempts to collect a number of best practices for bid
setup in one place. Important factors to consider include:

- Bid Price
- Bids and Campaign Priorities
- Network Inventory ID
- Targeting
- Waterfall Setup

For detailed instructions on creating bids, see [Mediation Bids](mediation-bids.md).

## Bid price

We recommend using the last 7 days' eCPM from each of your networks as a
starting point. This number can be pulled directly from each network's
UI, or from the **Bids** page in our
system if you have reporting enabled for that network. It is important
that bids are updated on a daily basis to maximize the value of the
auction. Inaccurate bids will have an adverse impact on seller revenue.

## Bids and campaign priorities

This section lists several important items to note about the interaction
between bids and campaign priorities.

**Priority for non-bid managed campaigns**

When a mediated bid is present, your other campaigns with priorities
less than 5 won't be evaluated in the auction.

**Priority for campaigns that are part of bids**

What we call a "bid" is actually made up of several objects, including a
campaign. This campaign's priority is set to 5 by default when your bid
is created in the UI, and shouldn't ever be changed.

If you change this campaign's priority the bid will stop working. This
can happen if you are updating campaign priorities via the API and
accidentally update a campaign that's part of a bid.

There are several ways to avoid this issue when using the API:

- Don't make any updates to advertisers, line items, campaigns, or
  creatives with the words "Mediated" or "Mediation" in their names.
- Creatives used for mediation have the `is_mediation` flag set. If
  you're updating a line item or campaign, you can check its `creatives`
  array to see if one of the creatives is a mediation creative. If so,
  don't update that line item or campaign.

## Bid optimization

We recommend using the **Bid
Optimization** feature on each bid to allow the system to
dynamically adjust bid price based on the frequency and recency of the
user. Enabling this feature will improve the accuracy of bids and
improve publisher yield. Even when bid optimization is enabled, it is
important to continue updating bid prices on a daily basis.

## Network inventory IDs

It is **critical** that each bid has a unique network ID. In other
words, do **not** share network IDs across bids. Using the same network
ID on multiple bids will cause revenue to be overcounted in reporting.

## Targeting

Whenever possible, it is best to create different bids by:

- Placement
- Ad size
- Geo
- Operating system

We've found these attributes to have the most impact on performance
within networks. Remember that each bid **must** have a unique network
inventory ID.

## Network waterfall

We recommend using no more than 3 or 4 networks in the waterfall for a
given impression. Using more than 4 networks will increase ad serving
latency and adversely impact the end user's experience. If too many
networks are active, we may not be able to retrieve an ad within the
time limit for content retrieval.
