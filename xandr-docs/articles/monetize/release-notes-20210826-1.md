# August 26, 2021: Cross Device Targeting for Europe - API Changes



On August 30, 2021, Tapad cross-device targeting for Europe will
officially end in Xandr's API. To continue
utilizing cross-device targeting for Europe within our API, the
cross-device targeting parameter (graph_id) in our Profile Service was
changed from 3 (Tapad) to 4 (Xandr). These new
options will be available on August 26, 2021. On August 30, 2021, Tapad
cross-device targeting will be removed from line items in the EU. The
line items will continue to run, but will no longer conduct cross-device
targeting.
