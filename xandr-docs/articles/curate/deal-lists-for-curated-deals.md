# Deal lists for curated deals

A deal is an agreement between a buyer, curator or seller that provides special access to inventory and/or data. Deals are primarily used to access preferred premium inventory, negotiated inventory or unique audiences.

A deal list is a group of deals IDs categorized under a single heading for targeting across curated deal line items. Deal lists allow curators to pre-define lists of seller deals for their operations team and streamline their workflows, making it easy to target the same group of seller deals across curated deal line items. If deal grouping requirements change, you can make the changes in the deal list and all curated deal line items will be updated accordingly.

## Manage deal lists

You can create and manage Deal Lists at the Member and Advertiser level. A deal list may contain one or more deal IDs and a deal ID can be added to multiple deal lists. However, a deal ID can be added only once to a single deal list. While adding or removing deals in a deal list, you can find the deals by deal id, deal name or deal alias. Additionally, deal IDs can be added to a list in bulk.
