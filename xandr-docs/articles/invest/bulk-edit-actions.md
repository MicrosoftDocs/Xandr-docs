# Bulk edit actions

You can use our bulk edit actions to update multiple advertiser, insertion order, and line item settings simultaneously from the buyer
monitoring grids.

> [!NOTE]
> To quickly run reports and edit details for multiple advertisers, insertion orders, and line items, select the corresponding checkboxes for the appropriate objects from the respective Advertisers, Insertion Orders, and Line Items grids and select a bulk edit action from the pull-down menu that displays in the blue toolbar. You'll be able to make the necessary edits directly within the dialog that is displayed.
