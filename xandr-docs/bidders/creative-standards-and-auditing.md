# Overview - Creative standards and auditing

Avoiding channel conflict is a major challenge for publishers working with a third party to sell their inventory. Every publisher has a unique sales pitch to top brand advertisers. Xandr understands the value of these advertiser relationships and how crucial these relationships are to a publisher's business. Any chance in jeopardizing business with top advertisers is not a risk worth taking. Xandr was built with publisher protection in mind, not as an afterthought. Xandr has brand and creative controls built in to address channel conflict.

Xandr enables publisher inventory to be auctioned on a per impression basis to premium brands. Xandr UI allows brand and creative management to manually control brand exclusions on specific publisher's properties.
