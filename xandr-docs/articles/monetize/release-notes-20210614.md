# June 14, 2021: Introducing a New ALI



We have revamped the **Create New Line Item** and **Edit Line Item**
screens to further streamline the process for creating and editing
augmented line items (ALIs). This involved renaming, reordering, and
regrouping various sections and fields. The
Cancel and
Save buttons now appear in the header
of the screen to maximize page space. A new collapsible sidebar has also
been added to make it easier to navigate between sections.
