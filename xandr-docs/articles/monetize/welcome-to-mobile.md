# Welcome to Mobile



As the world transitions toward heavier mobile device usage, learning
the ins and outs of mobile buying becomes essential. Luckily,
advertising on mobile apps is mostly similar to traditional web
advertising (and where it differs, we'll explain those differences - see
more below). The documentation in this section is designed to provide
you with a solid understanding of how advertising works on mobile apps.
Topics we'll cover include:

- The similarities and differences between mobile app and web.
- How to buy mobile inventory from various sources.
- How to work with mobile advertisers, including running
  cost-per-install offers and managing discrepancies.
- The current technical limitations that lead to different features in
  mobile app and web.
- How to access mobile-specific features using our APIs.



<b>Tip:</b> We've written this section
especially for clients who want to work with mobile advertisers and
inventory. However, most of what you'll need to do is covered by the
existing documentation, so don't forget to look there as well.
