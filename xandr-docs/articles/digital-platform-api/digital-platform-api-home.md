# Digital Platform API Home





Welcome to the documentation for Xandr's Digital Platform API. Our user
interfaces were built on top of the API, which means that almost
anything you can do in the UI you can do with the API using our
<a href="reference.html" class="xref">RESTful web services</a>. This
includes advertising campaign management, reporting, and publisher
management.



Note: Xandr's Digital Platform API is
powered by AppNexus technology, and at this time the
<a href="http://api.appnexus.com/" class="xref"
target="_blank">api.appnexus.com</a> endpoint is remaining unchanged.
