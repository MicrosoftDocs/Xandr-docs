# Associate Line Items with a Creative



When adding a new creative, you can associate existing line items to it,
which will cause the creative to automatically appear in the
Associated Creatives section of
the Edit Line Item screen so that
you don't have to manually associate it at the line item level. After
it's associated, you can schedule when the creative should serve and
apply creative rotation settings to it at the line item level.



Only line items that have been added previously in the system can be
selected from the Line Item
Association section. You can also use the
Bulk Edit menu from the
Creative Manager to associate
creatives at the line item level. For more information about associating
creatives with line items, see

Creatives with a Line Item</a>.





1.  Enter the partial/full name or ID of the
    existing line item in the Line
    Item text field.
2.  Select the appropriate line item from the list
    of results that displays.
