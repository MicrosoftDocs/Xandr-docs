# Yield Analytics 7.15



Support Period to Log Date - This is an option to select a dynamic a
date range of Period to Log Date, where the end date would be the log
data date. For clients with multiple integrations, the log data date
used would be the one furthest back in history.

There were changes made to search delimiters from “,” to “;” in the
filters in Analyzer and Reports. This makes it consistent with search
page filter delimiters throughout the application.



## Fixes

Scheduling for one report was being applied to multiple reports. Now it
will only be applied to the intended report

There has been some slowness in the calendar widget on the Product
Visibility screen that has been enhanced.
