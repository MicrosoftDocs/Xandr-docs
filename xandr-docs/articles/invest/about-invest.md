## Technical Details

The Xandr platform is a real-time bidding system
and ad server. The main processing system is called the "impression
bus". The impression bus receives ad requests, applies data to the
request, receives bids, makes decisions, serves creatives, logs
auctions, etc.

Ad calls come in via our inventory supply partners: exchanges, SSPs, ad
networks, and a few valued publishers. Some of the ad calls are
client-side, meaning there is aMicrosoft tag on the
page, and we get the call directly. Others are server-side, meaning our
partners initially field the call and then contact us asking for a bid.

Once we get the call, we overlay segment data from our server-side
cookie store. Data is added to the cookie store either through
Microsoft segment pixels or by clients sending us a
file of data. We also contact third-party data providers and overlay any
available data.

We contact all of the bidders on our platform. The ad call includes
whatever user data belongs to each bidder, and information about the
inventory. Bidders have a certain number of milliseconds in which to
respond with a bid and the creative they want to serve.

Invest DSP serves as our proprietary bidder,
which has a suite of features including targeting, bidding algorithms,
multi-currency support, and all the other features of a premium ad
server. It can be accessed by either a UI or API.

The impression bus decides which bid wins based on the amount of the
bid, and any preferences the publisher has about what they want served
on their page. If the call was client-side,
Microsoft serves the ad. If it was server-side,
Microsoft passes the bid and the location of the
creative to the partner who will ultimately serve the ad.
