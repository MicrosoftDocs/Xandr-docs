# Microsoft Monetize - October 22, 2025 - Automated deal archival

Automated Deal Archival ensures auctions are running efficiently on the Microsoft Advertising platform. The platform archives deals that buyers have not been using for a year or more. Archived deals remain visible in monitoring tools and reports but do not participate in auctions or generate bid requests.
