# Yield Analytics 8.73

| Fixes, Improvements and Additions | Integrations Affected |
|--|--|
| Order Import enhancements supporting changes to FreeWheel's Creative Management API endpoint. | FreeWheel |
| Order Import enhancements to "stream" translation entries into Yield Analytics. This provides the ability to manage the millions of translations required to support Google Ad Manager's video targeting options. | Google Ad Manager |
| Updated the old "dma" attribute to "metro_code", aligning with targeting screen changes made within Monetize. All existing product and line item/campaign targeting will be updated to reflect this new attribute and any new items will also utilize the "metro_code" attribute. The Availability Lookup screen will also be updated to only include the "metro_code" attribute. | Monetize |
