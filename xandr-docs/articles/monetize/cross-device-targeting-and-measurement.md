# Cross-Device Targeting and Measurement



Cross-device targeting and measurement, which can be enabled at the line
item level, ties together events or actions for a unique individual that
occur on different devices.

By tracking and managing each individual user's ad viewing and
conversion experience across the various devices they use, advertisers
can deliver a holistic brand experience to consumers and more accurately
measure the impact of ad spending on driving conversions.

Cross-device capability enhances targeting and attribution using
information from an identity graph, a database of customer information
that allows Xandr to identify users on multiple devices. Supported
identity graphs are:

- Xandr's identity graph, which covers the
  United States and Europe. The Xandr United
  States and Europe graphs are powered by market-leading data partners.
