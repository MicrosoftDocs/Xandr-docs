# Edit a User Group



If you have administrative permissions, you can edit user groups to add
and remove users in the group. You can also change the permissions for
the group.

    click Permissions. The Permissions
    page appears, displaying the Groups panel with a table of all
    existing user groups.
2.  Click the user group you want to edit. The Group: \[Group
    Name\] panel appears. \[Group Name\] is the name of the group you
    selected.
3.  Update the name and/or description of the group in
    the Group Summary section as
    needed.
4.  Add and remove users in the Users in This
    Group section as follows:
    - To add users to the group, in the list of usernames on the left,
      select each username you want to add (or
      click Select All to add all
      users). As you select users, they are highlighted in the list on
      the left, and added to the list on the right.
    - To remove users from the group, in the list of usernames on the
      right, click the X for each username you want to remove (or
      click Clear All to remove all
      users). As you select to remove users, they are deleted from the
      list on the right and un-highlighted in the list on the left.

    Group section. Select the check boxes for the features the
    group should be able to access. Clear the check boxes for the
    features the group shouldn't be able to access. The features are

    Tools, and Other.
