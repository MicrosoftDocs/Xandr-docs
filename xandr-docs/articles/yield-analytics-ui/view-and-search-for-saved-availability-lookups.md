# View and Search for Saved Availability Lookups



If you have administrative permissions, you can view saved availability
lookups.

1.  On the Admin Tools menu,
    click View Saved Lookups. The View
    Saved Lookups page appears, displaying a list of all saved
    availability lookups.
2.  (Optional) In the search box in the toolbar above the lookups list:
    Type a search term, change the search options as needed, and then
    press Enter. The lookup list is
    redisplayed to show only the availability lookups that match your
    search criteria.  
    - By default, the search returns lookups that contain the search
      term you entered. To change the type of search, on the drop-down
      list to the left of the search box,
      click Contains and select a
      different option (e.g., to search for lookups that starts with the
      search term you typed, select Starts
      With).
    - By default, the search is run against the name of the lookup, and
      the name of the user who created it. To narrow the search to just
      one of these, click All in the
      drop-down list to the right of the search box and select a
      different option (e.g., to search for lookups by lookup name only,
      select Name).
