# Cross device targeting for Europe

**Release date**: August 26, 2021

On August 30, 2021, Tapad cross-device targeting for Europe will officially end in Microsoft Advertising's API. To continue utilizing cross-device targeting for Europe within our API, the cross-device targeting parameter (`graph_id`) in our Profile Service was changed from 3 (Tapad) to 4 (Microsoft Advertising). These new options will be available on August 26, 2021. On August 30, 2021, Tapad cross-device targeting will be removed from line items in the EU. The line items will continue to run, but will no longer conduct cross-device targeting.

For more information, see [Profile Service](../digital-platform-api/profile-service.md).
