# Microsoft Monetize - Seller Monitoring Workflow (SMW) grid for Advertisers

An advertiser is a company, agency, or other grouping that displays media creatives on publisher web and/or mobile inventory. The Advertiser object is the top level of the buy side of the [Object Hierarchy](object-hierarchy.md).
Setting up the advertiser defines the advertiser's identity as well as some of the buying terms. The advertiser also serves as a container for other objects including insertion orders, line items, creatives, and pixels that you can combine to begin buying digital inventory.

Creating the advertiser is the first step in the [Basic Buy-side Setup Procedures](basic-buy-side-setup-procedures.md)
required for purchasing inventory.
