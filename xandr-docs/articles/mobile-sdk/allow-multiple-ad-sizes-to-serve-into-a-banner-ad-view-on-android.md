# Allow Multiple Ad Sizes to Serve into a Banner Ad View on Android



Banner ads with a fixed size may not get as much demand as you'd like.
To open up a banner ad view to more demand, and hopefully more revenue,
you can allow more than one ad size to serve.

Follow the instructions below to allow multiple ad sizes to serve into
your banner ad views.



To allow multiple ad sizes to serve into a banner ad view on Android,
use the following methods onÂ `BannerAdView`:

- `setAdSizes(ArrayList<AdSize> adSizes)`: Takes a list of the platform
  ad sizes that may be inserted into the current banner ad view.
- `getAdSizes()`: Returns the sizes allowed to be displayed in the
  current banner ad view.



**Example**:



``` pre
// Create the AdView and set its placement ID.
BannerAdView bav = new BannerAdView(this);
bav.setPlacementID("1326299");

// Build up the ad sizes array.
ArrayList<AdSize> sizes = new ArrayList<AdSize>();
sizes.add(new AdSize(300,  50));
sizes.add(new AdSize(300, 250));

// Pass the ad sizes array to the banner ad view.
bav.setAdSizes(sizes);

// Add the AdView to our layout.
FrameLayout layout = (FrameLayout)findViewById(android.R.id.content);
layout.addView(bav);

// Load an ad!
bav.loadAd();
```
