# Update Trader Home





Important: Trader Home is currently
available to a limited set of clients.



The cards in Trader Home display
essential information about insertion orders important to you. You can
add and remove cards to and from your Trader Home, depending on which
insertion orders you'd like to see.

Add a Card

Use the following steps to add a card:

1.  Create the insertion order you want to display in
    Trader Home. See
    <a href="create-an-insertion-order.html" class="xref">Create an
    Insertion Order</a> for more details.
    

    Tip: To display all available card
    metrics, your insertion order should have a budget and flight
    dates/billing period(s).

    
2.  On **Trader Home**, click the Add IOs to
    Home button and type the name or ID of the insertion order
    you want to add. This will display a list of insertion orders that
    match your search.
3.  Click the Add button next to the
    insertion order(s) you want to add to
    Trader Home. A card will
    display for each added insertion order.
    

    Tip: Cards can be dragged and
    dropped into a personalized order. The new order will save and
    display each time you use Trader
    Home.

    

Remove a Card

You can remove cards from Trader
Home. This is particularly useful when you no longer need to
watch an insertion order, or when you want to get rid of unnecessary or
accidentally added cards. There are two ways to remove a card from
Trader Home.



Note: Removing a card from **Trader
Home** does not delete it from the system. To delete an insertion order,
see <a href="update-insertion-orders.html" class="xref">Update Insertion
Orders</a>.



Remove a Card Using Card Settings

1.  On Trader Home, click the
    settings button in the top right corner of the card to flip the
    card.
2.  Click Remove this IO.



Important: If you do not want to remove
the card, click Done to flip the card
back.



Remove a Card Using Search

1.  On **Trader Home**, click the Add IOs to
    Home button and search for the insertion order by name or ID
    number.
2.  Click the Remove button next to
    the insertion order(s) you want to remove from
    Trader Home.
