# Microsoft Monetize - Mobile targeting and attribution challenges

In [Technical Limitations of Mobile Buying](technical-limitations-of-mobile-buying.md), we discussed
the technical realities that are keeping mobile buying features from
reaching full parity with display (for now). The most difficult problem
is to reliably perform cross-device targeting and conversion attribution
on mobile inventory. On this page, we provide an overview of the key
challenges that must be overcome.

## 1. Cross-Screen targeting and attribution

Also known as: **Desktops vs. Mobile Devices**

**Problem**: It is hard to identify users across devices. This makes it
difficult to target, frequency cap, and attribute conversions across
devices.

**Solution**: We believe a combination of technology and partnerships
with data providers will eventually provide the best solution. For now,
watch this space.

## 2. App-to-Browser targeting and attribution

Also known as: **Mobile Browsers vs. Apps**

**Problem**: Apps and browsers offer different methods for identifying
users. This creates several issues:

- Cannot retarget and frequency cap the same user across an app and the
  browser.
- Cannot track app downloads on iOS-powered devices when a user clicks
  on an ad in a browser. This is because of the situation with **Mobile
  Safari Cookies** (described below).

**Solution**: Possible solutions include integration with one or more
device recognition vendors, partnerships with major carriers, or both.

## 3. Inter-App targeting and attribution

Also known as: **Apps vs. Apps**

**Problem**: Android and some older iOS devices have no standardized
methods for identifying a user across apps. This creates several issues:

- Frequency capping and retargeting across Android apps may not always
  work.
- Tracking app download conversions may not work on older iOS versions.

**Solution**:

- Use Apple's "identifier for advertising" (`idfa`) on iOS 6 an above
  and `openudid` for older iOS devices.

- Use Google's advertising identifier (`aaid`) or standardize on the
  `sha1` device ID for Android devices.

  Xandr associates multiple device IDs to one
  Xandr cookie IDs. This allows us to do
  frequency capping using the mechanisms we already have in place. For
  more information about `idfa`, `sha1`, and the other mobile device IDs
  we support, see the [Mobile Ad Call Reference](mobile-ad-call-reference.md).

## 4. Mobile safari cookies

Also known as: **Safari vs. The World**

**Problem**: Mobile Safari (the default browser on iOS devices) does not
accept third party cookies, which impacts our ability to segment,
re-target, and apply frequency caps.

**Solution**: Like **App-to-Browser Targeting and Attribution**,
possible solutions include integration with one or more device
recognition vendors, partnerships with major carriers, or both.
