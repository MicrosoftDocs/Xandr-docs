# Real-time Signals Service API reference

The RTSS is used to upload ID-to-segment data or other key:value data used to add segments on bid requests.

## API usage

### Regional endpoint URLs

The `regional` endpoint URLs for all RTSS methods is listed below:

| Region | API Endpoint | Detailed reference |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Global | `https://api.appnexus.com/apd-api/` | The default endpoint resolves based on the uploader's origin and directs to either AMER, EMEA or APAC. |
| Americas and EMEA | `https://api.appnexus.com/apd-api-americas/` <br> or `https://api.appnexus.com/apd-api-emea/` | Data published to AMER is automatically replicated to EMEA. Uploads to these datacenters are shared, eliminating the need to upload the same file twice for both regions. |
| APAC | `https://api.appnexus.com/apd-api-apac/` | APAC datacenters operate independently and are not connected to AMER or EMEA.|

### Authentication

Authentication is performed through the [Digital Platform API authentication service](authentication-service.md). The Auth token retrieved from this service must be passed back to the RTSS service via the `Authorization` header, as outlined on the Auth Service page.

### HTTP headers

The following HTTP headers must be appended to your `regional` endpoint calls:

| Method | Required HTTP Headers |
|:---|:---|
| `GET` | `Accept: application/appnexus.apd.vauxhall.v1.0+json`|

## Segment fields

The following segment fields are common to the services listed on this page, and described in the section below:

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `seg_id` | int | The ID of the segment object. |
| `seg_val` | int | The value associated with the segment for the specified targeting. Segment values have a number of uses, from targetable features in campaigns and [Custom Models](../data-science-toolkit/custom-models.md) to computation inputs for [Bonsai Smart Leaves](../data-science-toolkit/bonsai-smart-leaves.md). The default value for targets uploaded without a `seg_val` is `0`.<br><br>**Note:** When you specify a `seg_val`, use the format `seg_id:seg_val:ttl`. Failure to do so may result in an incorrectly set value. |
| `seg_ttl` | int | The "time to live" for the segment association with the specified targeting. After the TTL duration has passed from the time of upload, the segment will no longer be associated with the specified targeting. Knowing when targets will expire can help you avoid uploading unnecessarily large files. If you need to frequently refresh segments or create new ones, for example when using OLC movement data derived from mobile app, you can also use `seg_ttl` to specify an expiration time period and ensure "old" items are deleted after a specific duration.<br><br>- The default TTL for segments uploaded without a `seg_ttl` value or an `expiry` value is `30` days.<br>- The maximum supported `seg_ttl` value is `365` days.<br><br>**Note:**<br>**`seg_ttl` versus expiry**<br>The TTL you set does not account for any processing delays. In other words, your effective TTL is calculated as TTL minus processing delay. For example, if the file is submitted on `3/1/2022 00:00:00` and processing starts the day after, then the effective TTL is `29` days and the segment expires on `3/31 00:00:00`. If you need to set segment expiration with very specific granularity, you should set it using `expiry`. `expiry` is set for the entire uploaded file, not at the segment level.<br>For the bulk upload format, a `seg_ttl` must be specified as an integer in seconds. For example, `1` day is represented as `86400`.<br><br>For individual uploads, use the following syntax to specify segment TTL durations:<br>- `"ns", "nano"`<br>- `"us", "Âµs", "micro"`<br>- `"ms", "milli"`<br>- `"s", "sec"`<br>- `"m", "min"`<br>- `"h", "hr", "hour"`<br>- `"d", "day"`<br>- `"w", "wk", "week"`<br><br>**Note:** Where the segment has a known `expiry` value (inherited from the file-level `expiry` setting) as well as a `seg_ttl` value, RTSS uses whichever value results in a shorter TTL. In other words, if the explicit TTL value would result in an earlier expiration, `seg_ttl` will determine the effective TTL. Otherwise, the `expiry` value will take priority.<br>For more information about using this parameter, see "Target Expiry" in [RTSS Best Practices](rtss-best-practices.md). |

|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `200` | `GET`, `POST` | Success | `X-AuditID` | Reference Audit ID |

### File format and upload examples

#### File format

| **`keytype`** | separator | **`key`** | separator | **`action`** | separator | **`segment`** | separator | **`segment`** |

- **Columns**: `keytype`, `key`, `action`, `segment`
- **Separators**: comma `,` or tab `0x09` `\t` (csv or tsv files)
- **Line separator**: `0x0A` `\n`
- Representation of each column must be less or equal to **`32,767` byt `keytype` and `key` Columns**

| `keytype` ID | Type | `key` Examples |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `0` | string | - Single IP address: `"127.0.0.1"` |
| `2` | string | Geo hashcode in OLC format:<br>[OLC spec](https://openlocationcode.com/) |
| `3` | string | Postal code<br>**Note:** Postal codes targets will be **deprecated** soon.<br>`"11235"` |
| `4` | string | Partial URL (up to 3 paths)<br>- `mysampledomain.com`<br>- `mysampledomain.com/en/buyers`<br>- `mysampledomain.com/en/buyers/page` |
| `6` | string | Full URL<br>`mysampledomain.com/many/paths/are/supported` |

##### `action` column

| ID | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `0` | Add to segment |
| `1` | Remove from segment |

##### `segment` column

The segment column can contain:

- `segment_id;segment_id`
- `segment_id:segment_value`
- `segment_id:segment_value:segment_ttl`

When only the `segment_id` is provided, RTSS will assume that segment value is `0`, and segment a TTL of `default` (30 days).

`segment_ttl` must be an integer, indicating TTL duration in **seconds** only.

###### Example CSV file

The header row in the sample file below can be excluded. The bulk upload service will accept files with or without a header.

```
