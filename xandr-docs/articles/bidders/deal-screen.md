## Main screen metrics

The Main deal screen lists all of the deals for a bidder, and their associated attributes/metadata. The table below details each of the
columns displayed:

| **Column Name** | **Filterable** | **Description** |
|--|--|--|
| **Buyers** | Yes | The buying member or seat who can target this deal. Can be Xandr Member ID or DSP Buyer Seat ID.<br>Both the ID and name for the buyer is listed in this column. |

| **Activity Status** | Yes | Indicates if deal is Active or Inactive. |
|**Deal Name/ID** | Yes | Name of the deal and Xandr Deal ID. |
| **Deal Types** | Yes | The type of deal. A deal can be an **open auction** or a **private auction**.<br> - **Open Auction**<br>: In an "Open Auction", **buyers targeting the deals and buyers targeting the inventory via other means compete for the impression.** If a buyer targeting a deal submits the highest bid and the bid clears the deal's floor, that buyer wins the auction, paying either the second-highest bid or the deal floor price, whichever is higher. If one of the non-deal buyers submits the highest bid, that buyer wins the auction, paying either the second-highest bid or ECP, whichever is higher. <br> - **Private Auction**<br>: In a "Private Auction", **buyers targeting the private deals compete for the impression first**. Then, if none of the deal buyers win, the auction is opened to buyers targeting the inventory via other means. If a buyer targeting a deal submits a bid higher than the deal's floor and higher than any other private auction bids, that buyer wins the auction, paying either the second-highest bid from the private auction or the deal floor price, whichever is higher. If no private auction deals clear their floors, the highest bid in the open auction wins, paying either the second-highest bid from the open auction or ECP, whichever is higher.<br>For examples showing how these different types of auctions work, see [Deal Auction Mechanics](deal-auction-mechanics.md). |
