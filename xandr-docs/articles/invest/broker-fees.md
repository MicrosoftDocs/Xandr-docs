# Microsoft Invest - Broker fees

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Broker fees are deprecated on augmented line items and programmatic guaranteed line items. If you wish to track a third-party fee for an ALI or PGLI, please use [Partner Fees](partner-fees.md).

You may see references to broker fees in some reports on historical data as "commissions". For reports run on data from September 10, 2019 or later, current commissions always equal to $0.
