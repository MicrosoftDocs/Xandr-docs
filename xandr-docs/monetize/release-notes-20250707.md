# July 7, 2025 - Changes to DV360 Deal Sync Functionality

## Overview:

Starting July 7, 2025, Microsoft Monetize and Curate will no longer support the ability to target multiple DV360 Partner IDs in a single deal. This update aligns with Google DV360's shift toward the use of Central Partner IDs.

## Whatâ€™s Changing:

- The option to select multiple DV360 Partner IDs in the deal targeting UI will be removed.
- New deals must be created using a single standard Partner ID.
- Multi-seat (multi-buyer) deal creation will no longer be supported.
- Existing deals with multiple Partner IDs will remain active but cannot be edited to include additional seats.

## Impact:
No disruption to existing deals with multiple Partner IDs. They will continue to transact normally. However, new multi-seat deal creation will be restricted.

## Looking Ahead:
Microsoft is actively working to support DV360's Central Partner ID model. This future capability will allow publishers to create scalable, DV360-compliant multi-buyer deals once again.

## Action Required:
Please ensure that all new DV360 deal setups follow the single Partner ID model beginning July 7, 2025.
