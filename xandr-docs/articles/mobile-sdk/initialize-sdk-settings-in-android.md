# Initialize SDK settings in Android

## Overview

SDKSettings in Xandr Mobile SDK is a API that can be called to activate OMID, fetch User Agent and AAID (Google Advertising ID) for devices. The initialization `init()` method passes these parameters as arguments in the SDK. However, fetching of User Agent involves instantiating a WebView to get the User Agent string on the UI thread. However this contributes for a delayed app start up apart
from retrieving and setting the AAID on a worker thread. To mitigate this situation and to improve the app launch performance, an additional flexible `init()`method is provided using which you can disable fetching of User Agent and AAID for devices optionally.

## Method

### init()

The `init()` method activates OMID, fetch User Agent, AAID (Google Advertising ID), enables `WarmUpAdCall` and prefetch WebView for devices.

``` 
public static void init(activateOmid, fetchUserAgent, fetchAAID, enableWarmUpAdCall, preFetchWebView)
```

Additionally, below is the overloaded `init()` method that optionally disable fetching of AAID and UserAgent. It requires enable/disable
booleans for `fetchUserAgent` and `fetchAAID` as arguments. Additionally, below is the overloaded `init()` method that optionally
disable fetching of AAID, UserAgent, `enableWarmUpAdCall` and `preFetchWebView`. It requires enable/disable booleans for fetchUserAgent, `fetchAAID`, `enableWarmUpAdCall`, and `preFetchWebView` as arguments.

``` 
public static void init(final boolean fetchUserAgent, final boolean fetchAAID,final boolean enableWarmUpAdCall, final boolean preFetchWebView)
```

## Example

``` 
// Regular Init method
SDKSettings.init(this, new SDKSettings.InitListener() {
    @Override
    public void onInitFinished() {
        // Initialisation finished
    }
});
// Overloaded Init method with flexibility to enable / disable fetching of User Agent, AAID, WarmUpAdCall and Prefetch WebView
SDKSettings.init(this, new SDKSettings.InitListener() {
    @Override
    public void onInitFinished() {
        // Initialisation finished
    }
}, false, true, false, false);
//Boolean values false/true are optional and as per usage
```
