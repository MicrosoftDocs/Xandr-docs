# QPS FAQ




## Summary

QPS is defined as queries per second. For external bidders, QPS is used
to describe the total number of bid requests that can be sent per
second. The implementation of QPS is accomplished via the field,
*qps_limit*, on the *bidder_instance* object. This allows the external
bidder to set a maximum traffic to be sent to per datacenter.




## Details

The purpose of QPS for external bidders is to ensure the bidder's
servers do not receive more traffic than they can process. It is not
meant to be the optimal amount of traffic. The bidder can receive
traffic lower than the *qps_limit* value, based on the available
inventory, how the bidder's profiles are configured, and their bidder's
performance. For example, here's a bidder instance configuration:

``` pre
{"id": 12345,
"active": true,
"datacenter_id": 6,
"port": 80,
"hostname": "dsp.goodstuff.com",
"qps_limit": 1000}
```

This instance is configured to receive a maximum of 1000 bid requests
per second.

Let's look at the available traffic for this bidder:

Here's what's sent to this bidder:

As the available inventory fluctuates (due to normal human web browsing
behavior), the bid requests sent to the bidder will also fluctuate in a
similar manner.Since this bidder has set the *qps_limit* value to 1000,
the traffic is being limited to that value and this is reflected in
Figure 2.




## Traffic Calculation

Figure 1 shows the traffic fluctuates from a low of 50k to a high of
175k. Figure 2 shows the bidder has received from a low of 400 to a high
of 1000 (the *qps_limit* value).




## How is this calculated?

There are 7 key metrics used in determining the final bid requests sent.
The follow two tables detail these metrics and how they are utilized.

Before calculating the Bid requests - Sent value, it is worth reviewing
how we determine what bid requests are available.

Sellers have controls that can limit which bidders can receive traffic.
When a seller blocks the buyer members of a bidder in the Ad Quality
Rules, that bidder will not receive bid requests from that seller.
Sellers can also use a visibility profile to block bid requests from
being sent to a bidder.

The Timing â€“ Timeout % metric consists of three components:

1.  The bidder has sent a bid response, but the bid response was not
    received in time to be eligible for the auction.
2.  The bidder has not sent a bid response to the auction.
3.  The bidder has sent a bid response and is eligible for the auction,
    however, the bid response came in towards the end of the maximum
    allowed time. There are bid requests that have been waiting to be
    sent that will be timed out, since the adserver has determined the
    bidder cannot respond in time.

Here is an example of a bid request that was timed out on a given
connection since only one bid request can be sent on a given connection
at a time (using a default maximum allowed time of 100ms):

- Time 0ms: bid request 1 sent to your bidder
- Time 1ms: bid request 2 queued
- Time 1.5ms: bid request 3 queued
- Time 99ms: bid response 1 received
- Time 100ms: bid request 2 sent
- Time 102ms: bid request 3 timed out before the request was sent
