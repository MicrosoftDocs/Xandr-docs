# Floor Prices



A floor price is the minimum net bid price that a seller is willing to
accept for a bid in an auction. To win an auction that has a set floor
price, the buyer's bid must be greater than or equal to the floor price.

Bids that are below a seller's established floor price won't be accepted
for that auction. It's also possible for a win-less auction to occur in
which no buyer has made a bid that meets the net floor price.

## Floor Types

<div id="floor-prices__p_144ca296-2068-4854-a6e1-3db02235c81d"

Two types of floors exist:

- **Hard Floor:** The minimum net price that a seller will accept for a
  bid. If the net price for the hard floor isn't met, then no bids are
  accepted and the auction ends without a winner, or a default creative
  is served. A bid will be considered only if it is equal to or greater
  than the hard floor.
  

  Note: When there is only one bid that
  exceeds the hard floor and wins the auction, that bid is reduced to
  the value of the hard floor, assuming there is no soft floor.

  
- **Soft Floor:** The lowest net price that a bid is reduced to by the
  seller. Essentially, a soft floor allows the network to alter the
  mechanics of the standard second-price auction. In a second-price
  auction, the winning bidder pays the value of the second highest bid
  in addition to $0.01. However, when a soft floor is set, the winning
  bidder pays either the soft floor's net price or the second bidder's
  bid depending upon which one is greater. If the winnerâ€™s bid is higher
  than the hard floor, but lower than the soft floor, the winner pays
  the price that they've bid. For more information, see <a

  Note: A soft floor can't be lower
  than a hard floor.

## Hierarchy of Floor Price Settings

The following numbered table shows the order in which floor price
settings are honored. A setting higher in the table will take precedence
over the settings lower in the table.



Note: All set floor prices within
Monetize are net values.
