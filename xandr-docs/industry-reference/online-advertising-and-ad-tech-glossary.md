# Online advertising and Ad tech glossary

The Xandr Online Advertising and Ad Tech
Glossary provides definitions of common and important terms relating to
online advertising, ad tech, and ad trading. 

## A-C

### acquisition

When a [user](#user) signs up, makes a purchase, or performs some other
desired action in response to an ad displayed on the Internet. Also
called a [conversion](#conversion) or action. See also [CPA](#cpa).

### ad agency

A company that provides services such as planning, creating, buying, and
tracking advertisements and ad campaigns on behalf of a client. Often,
people confuse media agencies, which are allocators of marketers'
spending across channels – with creative agencies, which are responsible
for the creation of actual ads and campaign content. 

### ad call

When an open slot of ad space is available on the Internet, a user's
browser sends requests to ad exchanges or ad servers to send an ad. This
request is known as an ad call. Ad calls include information from
browser cookies and ad tag information such as publisher ID, size,
location, referring URL, and other specifications and data needed for
the ad to serve. See also [ad tag](online-advertising-and-ad-tech-glossary.md#ad-tag). 

### ad pod

An individual ad pod is a group of ads expected to play back-to-back in
one commercial ad break. It is similar to how consumers experience
commercial ad breaks in broadcast television. An ad pod can be of
varying lengths and can be inserted at any point in a stream of content
(pre, mid, or post).

### AdChoices icon

"AdChoices" is part of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)
Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. The clickable
icon associated with this program (technically named the "Advertising
Option Icon") can be placed overtop of creatives to give consumers a
better understanding of and greater control over ads that are customized
based on their online behavior. See the icon and read more at the
[DAA's website](https://youradchoices.com/).

### ad exchange

An ad trafficking system through which advertisers, publishers, and
networks meet and do business via a unified platform. An ad exchange
allows advertisers and publishers to use the same technological
platform, services, and methods, and "speak the same language" in order
to exchange data, set prices, and ultimately serve an ad.

### advertising Id

AdId is a unique, user-resettable ID for advertising, provided by Google
Play services.

### ad network

A company that serves as a broker between a group of publishers and a
group of advertisers by aggregating inventory and audiences from
numerous sources in a single buy. Ad networks traditionally aggregate
unsold inventory from publishers in order to offer advertisers a
consolidated and generally less expensive pool of impressions, but they
can have a wide variety of business models and clients. In the context
of ad trafficking and ad tech, the term "[network](#network)" is generally taken to mean an ad network.

### ad server

The computer or group of computers responsible for actually serving
creatives to websites, or for making decisions about what ads will
serve. An ad server may also track clicks on ads and other data. Major
publishers, networks, and advertisers sometimes have one or more of
their own ad servers. For example, Xandr offers
several types of ad servers, each with different capabilities and
features.

### ad tag

A piece of HTML on a webpage that will contact an ad server and ask for
an ad. The tag informs the browser to open a small window (say, 468×60
pixels), and place whatever content is returned from some location (like
`http://ad.adserver.com/imp?Z=468×60&s`) in that window. Note that ad
tags are related, but not identical, to [placements](#placement), which are actually part of the information
embedded into ad tags. Here is an example JavaScript ad tag:

``` 
<SCRIPT language='JavaScript1.1' src="http://ad.adserver.net/adj/N4617.somdomain.com/B2850779;abr=!ie;sz=250x250;ord=[timestamp]?" ></SCRIPT>
```

### ad unit

An Ad or set of ads displayed as a result of a piece of  ad code
executing. A single unit of ad space.

### ad targeting

The practice of serving an ad to the appropriate audience based on data.
Ad targeting can involve demographic, geographical, behavioral or
psychographic data.

### addressable

The ability to dynamically serve targeted ads to the household or user
based on deterministic identifiers, allowing brands to define and serve
their message to the best qualified audience, wherever and whenever
they're watching.

### addressable TV

The ability to dynamically serve targeted ads to specific TV households
based on deterministic identifiers, allowing brands to define and serve
their message to the best qualified audience, wherever and whenever
they're watching content on TV, connected TV, or //STB.

### addressable video

The ability to dynamically serve targeted ads to the HH or user based on
deterministic identifiers, allowing brands to define and serve their
message to the best qualified audience, where ever and whenever they're
watching video content on any device.

### advanced TV

Any television content that has evolved beyond traditional, linear
television delivery models. This umbrella term is inclusive of the
following:

- **Connected TV (CTV)**: A TV that is connected to the Internet via an
  external (for example, streaming devices and gaming consoles) or
  internal device (for example, a smart television)
- **Smart TV**: A subset of Connected TV.
- **Addressable TV**: The ability to serve targeted ads to the HH or user
  based on deterministic identifiers, allowing brands to define and
  serve their message to the best qualified audience, where ever and
  whenever they're watching.
- **OTT**: (over-the-top) TV-like video content delivered over the internet,
  bypassing traditional TV infrastructure.
- **Interactive TV (iTV)**: The catch-all term for adding a viewer
  engagement piece to television, which may include interactive content,
  interactive advertising or ichannels. This can be delivered in a
  variety of ways, including through the first- and second-screen.

### advertiser

 The company paying for the advertisement.

### agency

See [ad agency](online-advertising-and-ad-tech-glossary.md#ad-agency).

### allowlist

A list of television networks, site domains, or apps that a buyer
explicitly wants to buy ad space on.

### API

An API, or application programming interface, is a programming method
used to interact with software, applications, or tools. APIs provide a
simplified querying language that allows consumers or developers to
access underlying databases and hardware without disrupting stability or
reliability, and without knowledge of underlying programming languages.
They may be based on a variety of programming languages and models, but
the types of APIs used by consumers to interact with Web-based software
or apps are often known as SOAP or [REST](#rest) services, which consist of a set of specifications
for remote calls that enable consumers to interact with data and systems
without the risk of disrupting their function. For example,
Xandr uses a RESTful API to facilitate
interaction with its Web-based software. 

### attribution

The process of identifying a set of user actions across screens and
touch points that contribute in some manner to a desired outcome, and
then assigning value to each of these events. Attribution offers
advertisers the opportunity to understand how media can drive sales,
awareness, purchase intent, and other measurable KPIs.

### audience deficit unit (ADU)

Additional, no charge audience units that are added to make up for
shortfall/underdelivery on a paid schedule. Can be applied to later
campaigns instead, sometimes.

### audience graph

An audience graph combines the notion of a Customer Profile with an ID
Graph, which allows companies to understand both who their customers are
as well as what they are doing.

### autoplay video ad

A video ad or an ad linked with video content that initiates ‘‘play’’
without user interaction or without an explicit action to start the
video (essentially automatically starting without a ‘‘play’’ button
being clicked by the user).

### audible and viewable on complete (AVOC)

The percentage of measurable impressions that were played, and were
audible and visible when the video has reached the deemed completion
mark. The video could be deemed complete at the end of the video or
after a certain number of pre-determined seconds.

### automated content recognition (ACR)

ACR is an opt-in identification technology embedded in a device that
allows content to be recognized by video, audio or watermark cues and
matched back to a data base for verification. This technology can
recognize content regardless of its distribution source (i.e. OTT,
linear, etc.). Marketers use this information to understand when a
consumer has seen their ads. 

### average audience (AA)

The estimated average audience of a program during a time increment of
its duration.

### average audience projection / impression

The rating expressed in numeric rather than percentage form.

### average hours of viewing

HUT/PVT converted to the average hours of viewing per home or per
person. The two measurements are simply different ways to express the
same statistic. Average Hours = Duration of the period x HUT%

### average frequency

The average number of times a household or person viewed a given
television program, station or commercial during a specific time period.

### advertising video on demand (AVOD)

AVOD is an OTT service that provides free or reduced-cost video on
demand that is displayed with various types of advertising (pre-roll,
mid-roll, post-roll, or more creative types such as pause ads). As an
alternative to SVOD, AVOD offers free streaming with advertising.
Services include traditional broadcasters’ BVOD players (eg. ITV Player)
and a new wave of digital-native AVODs (e.g. Tubi).

### backfill

Inventory that is not pre-sold, also known as [remnant inventory](#remnant-inventory). Can also refer to one ad network
filling unsold inventory for another ad network.

### back-to-back ads

Playing out the same ad repeatedly kills effectiveness. Back-to-back
play-out control limits the risk of repeat.

### banner ad

A basic image or flash display ad, rather than a rich media unit.

### behavioral data

Information collected from a users' online actions, for example, things
they’ve searched for in the past and types of website they frequent.
Advertisers sometimes use this type of data in their campaigns to match
relevant users with their offers, in a privacy and data compliant way.

### bidder

A bidder is a piece of technology that uses proprietary code and
algorithms to analyze bid requests and respond with bids and creatives
in real-time auctions. For example, Xandr hosts
a bidder that represents Xandr UI clients'
buy-side settings.

### bidding strategy

A bidding strategy is the way a buyer calculates a bid in an ad auction.
It can mean bidding a flat [CPM](#cpm) or bidding a variable price based on past
clickthrough or conversion rates.

### bid request

A request sent to a [bidder](#bidder) that asks it to return a bid for a given
impression. Bid requests include data points about the user and the
impression being sold.

### bitrate or bit rate

- **Encoded bit rate**: The number of bits (or amount of data) per second
  that has been used to store a media signal. In audio, this usually is
  presented in kilobits per second (or kb/s or kbps), while for
  high-quality video, this might be presented in megabits per second (or
  Mbps, or Mb/s). For example, the music you buy on iTunes is 256
  kilobits per second, meaning there are 256 kilobits of data stored in
  every second of a song, and an HD video file might be encoded at 2.0
  megabits per second, meaning there are two megabits of data. The 
  encoded bit rate is the one used for business requirements as it
  represents a strong signal of fidelity.
- **Available bit rate**: The instantaneous delivery rate of data in bits
  per second (bps), kilobits per second (kbps), megabits per second
  (mbps), etc. from the source server to destination device through one
  or many digital networks. The slowest portion of the network path
  determines the end-to-end maximum bitrate of the delivered stream.
  Some media content such as audio streams may use less than the maximum
  available bandwidth. HTTS Live Streaming (HLS) is a variable bitrate
  protocol for delivering video content. HLS starts the stream at a low
  bitrate which provides low video resolution and increases the bitrate
  and video resolution as the network conditions permit. The available
  bit rate is used for technical purposes as it represents how much data
  can be passed from the ad server to the client for an ad to deliver
  without jitter.

### blocklist

A list of television networks, site domains, or apps that a buyer
doesn't want to buy ad space on.

### brand

A company's product line and the image and reputation of that line. Many
stakeholders in the ad tech industry have guidelines or requirements for
the use of branding in creatives. Can also refer to a specific company
name, such as Coke, Target, Honda, and so on.

### broadcast networks

Video content that is aired on ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX or the CW.

### broadcast VOD

the CW and are viewed via linear pay TV or OTT.

### campaign

In advertising, a campaign is a set of media that has a shared themes
and ideas to market a specific brand, product, or concept. Most
campaigns also include criteria such as a specific start and end date,
daily or overall budgets, frequency restrictions, and targeting based on
user or inventory data. Ad campaigns run on a variety of places
including linear television, connected TV, online and apps.

## CDN

Content delivery network. A CDN delivers static content, such as
creative image or flash files. Usually, CDN providers have servers
across the globe configured to deliver content as quickly as possible,
which is why it's typical for ad servers to rely on them.

### click log

A server-side log of predefined information gathered when when a user
clicks on an ad.

### click-through rate

See [CTR](#ctr).

### click URL

If a publisher is being paid on a [CPC](#cpc) basis and wants to track clicks, they can provide
click-tracking URL where it is possible to ping them each time a user
clicks on an ad. Click URLs can also be used by to record clicks en
route to a [landing page](#landing-page). See also [publisher click-tracking](#publisher-click-tracking). 

### competitive separation

Ensures a publisher’s ad pod does not include conflicting brands or
categories, thereby reducing competition and consumer ad fatigue, and
increasing the value of the spot.

### cloud

In general, a computing cloud is a networked group of servers accessible
through remote means. In ad tech, this usually refers refers to cloud
computing infrastructure on which an ad platform of some kind runs. Data
or processes existing within such a network is sometimes said to be "in
the cloud". 

### connected audio

An audio device that is connected to the internet via an external device
(For example: a smart speaker or a bluetooth speaker). An external audio
device plays media content by streaming from the internet or local
storage. Connected audio is only available when your ad type is
"**Audio**". Smart streaming audio devices include Google Home Max,
Amazon Echo, Apple HomePod, etc.

### connected TV (CTV)

A TV that is connected to the Internet via an external (for example:
streaming devices and gaming consoles) or internal device (for example:
a smart television). CTV devices are the hardware used to access content
over the top. They include dedicated streaming dongles (eg. Roku, Apple
TV, Chromecast, Fire TV), games consoles like Xbox and Playstation and
integrated smart TV sets.

### container tag

See [tag container](#tag-container).

### contextual data

Information on the contents of the webpage that a user is viewing upon
ad call, usually used for ad targeting. For example, if the user is
viewing a newspaper article about travel, an airline may wish to display
on that page. This is distinct from [user data](#user-data). See also [semantic targeting](#semantic-targeting).

### contextual targeting

Buying ads against the TV show, rather than the audience, based on
certain descriptive metadata like genre, mood or subject matter.

### conversion

When a user signs up, makes a purchase, or performs some other desired
action in response to an ad. Also called an
[acquisition](online-advertising-and-ad-tech-glossary.md#acquisition) or action, especially to distinguish
conversions/acquisitions from clicks in payment methods ([CPC](#cpc) vs. [CPA](#cpa)).

### conversion attribution

See [attribution](#attribution). 

### conversion funnel

This describes the journey a consumer takes as a sum of experiences when
interacting with your company and brand. Instead of looking at just part
of a transaction or experience, the customer funnel looks at the full
experience from awareness to consideration to intent and finally
conversion or purchase.

### conversion pixel

A pixel that fires when a user "converts" by clicking on a ad,
registering, making a purchase, or completing another action.
Advertisers can place conversion pixels on a [landing page](#landing-page), registration page, checkout pages, or
elsewhere to track conversions.

### converged buying

As traditional TV evolves, CTV grows and media continue to fragment, the
industry wants to combine buying and selling activities across the
ecosystem, to enable unified planning, buying and measurement across
media channels.

### cookie

A parcel of text sent by a server to the cookie file in a browser and
then sent back unchanged by the client each time it accesses that
server. HTTP cookies are used for authenticating, session tracking, and
storing information about specific users, such as site preferences or
buying habits. Advertisers often use cookies to track the number and
frequency of advertisements that have been shown. See also [first-party cookies](#first-party-cookies) and [third-party cookies](#third-party-cookies).

### cost per viewable impression

A pricing model where the advertiser only pays for video ad impressions
that are considered viewable based upon MRC and IAB viewability
guidelines. Typically sold at 1000 impressions.

### cost plus

network or specialty channel. The number of stations transmitting the
program.

Coverage Area Rating % = Average Audience % ÷ Coverage Area Universe
Estimate

### CPA

Cost per action/acquisition. A payment model in which advertisers pay
for every action, such as a sale or registration, completed as a result
of a visitor clicking on their advertisement. Note that an
"[acquisition](#acquisition)" is the same as a "[conversion](#conversion)".

### CPI

time a user installs their app.   

### CPC

Cost per click. A payment model in which advertisers pay each time a
user clicks on their advertisement.

### CPCV

Cost per completed View. The price an advertiser pays every time a video
ad runs through to completion. Rather than paying for all impressions,
some of which may have been stopped before completion, an advertiser
only pays for ads that finished (CPCV = Cost ÷ Completed Views).

### CPM

Cost per mille, or thousand (mille = thousand in Latin). A pricing model
in which advertisers pay for every 1000 impressions of their
advertisement served. This is the standard basic pricing model for
online advertising. See also [CPC](#cpc) and [CPA](#cpa).

### CPP

Cost per rating point. The cost to deliver a single rating point. CPP =
Average Unit Cost/Rating % or Total Schedule Cost/GRPs.

### CPV

Cost per view. A pricing model where the advertiser only pays for a
video start. Typically sold at 1000 impressions.

### CPVM

Renamed. See [vCPM](#vcpm).

and guidelines, for the purpose of communicating a marketing message to
that publisher’s audience. A creative can include images, animation,
video, interactive experiences or more.

### creative tag

touch-points within STB, CTV, desktop and mobile.

### cross-screen measurement

Tracking and measurement of video metrics across
Mobile/Tablet/Out-of-Home/Television/Advanced TV/Desktop.

inventory packaging solution. Curated deals launch campaigns against a
single Deal ID, so no wasted time and resources are dedicated towards
publisher sourcing and deal creation.

### Customer Profile

assigned to specific individuals or households.

## D-L

### DAA

### daisy chain

When the linking of several ad tags, usually from different exchanges,
ad servers, or ad networks, creates a "waterfall"  – or "daisy chain"
– of impressions passing from tag to tag. If no creative is found via
the demand available to Ad Tag 1, the impression can be passed to Ad Tag
2, Ad Tag 3, and Ad Tag 4 to see if demand is available there, and so on
until a creative is found and served. 

### data-driven linear

The ability to use different data sets including demographics,
interests, and viewing behavior to optimize a linear TV schedule that
uses specific networks and day parts to better reach an advertiser's
audience. 

### data management platform

In ad tech, a data management platform (DMP) is a centralized system for
gathering first-party data, integrating with third-party data, and
applying this data to one's advertising strategy. A DMP may offer the
following features: estimating the likely reach for a user segment,
measuring the lift from using data, acting as a financial clearing house
between data buyers and sellers, and assisting publishers in monetizing
data on their users. DMPs most commonly work with [user data](#user-data) but may also work with [contextual data](#contextual-data), or other types of data.

### data provider

A business that collects data about users, companies and brands and
makes the information available in a safe and data compliant way for
advertisers to better understand and serve media to their audiences.

### decisioning

The automated process by which an ad server, ad platform, or exchange
literally decides where, how, and to whom to serve an ad. This can be
based on an auction prioritizing certain kinds of online ad space,
prioritizing advertisers based on relationships and prior agreements, or
other methods. 

### deduplication

Sometimes known as "de-duping" – means removing duplicate entries or
events in a data set. Effective [programmatic buying](#programmatic-buying) is dependent on getting accurate
and useful data sets, and deduplication is often a step in that process.
For example, if a user clicks twice on the same creative but these two
actions are only linked to a single [conversion](#conversion), it's possible to de-dupe the associated
data set to prevent it from counting second clicks.

### default creative/reserve creative

A default creative is a creative that runs as a backup in an open
Internet ad space, in the case that no other creatives are available. A
default creative can be a literal creative, say an in-house ad, or it
can be a redirect in the form of a third-party [ad tag](#ad-tag) to a third-party [ad server](#ad-server). A default creative may also be called a "reserve creative."  

### default tag

If no impression can be found for an ad opportunity, a default
[tag](#tag) may be served. The tag is passed to a third-party 
[ad server](#ad-server) to see if demand can be found there (this
happens in the case of [daisy chaining](#daisy-chain)) or to simply pull a creative from that
server. Sometimes called a [passback](#passback).

### demand

Advertising demand, or the desire to buy ad space and display creatives.

### demand side platform (DSP)

Technology that allows advertisers to buy impressions across a range of
publisher sites, but targeted to specific users based on information
including location and previous browsing behavior. Publishers make ad
impressions available through programmatic marketplaces and DSPs
automatically decide which impressions make the most sense for an
advertiser to buy.

### deterministic data

Known data that identifies a consumer via a 1:1 match of two or more
data sets based on unique identifiers.

### deterministic ID

Audience profiles built from verified known subscriber or user data,
authenticated from TV services.

### device-Level targeting

More-granular targeting that identifies, profiles and reaches a specific
device, whether it is a smart TV, mobile phone or desktop computer.

### digital ad rating (DAR)

DAR is a tag created by Nielsen that is placed on a web page or within a
CTV app that provides cookie based audience demographic reach
measurement.

### digital out-of-home advertising

See 
[DOOH](#dooh).

### direct response

A term applied to marketing or advertising that is designed to solicit a
direct response which is specific and quantifiable. In online display
advertising, examples of this can include clicking on an ad, making a
purchase, signing up for a newsletter, and so on. 

### display advertising

Online advertising is often divided into "display" and "search." Display
ads are images and search is text based. Display ads, sometimes referred
to as banners, come in standardized ad sizes, and can include text,
logos, pictures, or rich media.

### direct marketing association (DMA)

An independent nonprofit organization of "data-driven marketers" whose
stated mission is to "advance and protect responsible data-driven
marketing". For more information, see the DMA

### direct media buy

A pre-brokered agreement between an advertiser and publisher to deliver
a certain amount of specific inventory for a preset cost.

### direct response

direct response which is specific and quantifiable. In online display
advertising, examples of this can include clicking on an ad, making a
purchase, signing up for a newsletter, and so on.

### direct marketing association (DMA) online behavioral advertising (OBA) compliance

The Direct Marketing Association has been heavily involved in creating
guidelines for online behavioral advertising (OBA), or advertising to
people surfing the Internet based on their past browsing history. For
more information, see the
[DMA Website](https://www.ana.net/content/show?id=thedmaorg-redirect).

### DMP

### DOOH

Digital out-of-home advertising is dynamic media experienced outside of
the home, such as on digital billboards and other signage.

### DR

See [direct response](#direct-response).

### DSP

See [demand side platform](#demand-side-platform-dsp).

### duration averaging

Averaging programs together by weighting according to the length of each
program. 

### dynamic ad insertion (DAI)

Technology that allows advertisers to swap out ad creatives in video on
live and on demand content based on who the ad is intended for. This
allows ads to be served to unique and targeted individuals rather than
TV broadcast commercials where all viewers are served the same ad. It
enhances the ability to swap out an ad in a TV show, based on audience
targeting signals or buyer strategy. It was originated in VOD, but now
emerging in live digital linear streams.

### dynamic creative

Many advertisers wish to show different ads to different customers; for
example, an advertiser might wish to show rain gear to people who live
in rainy climates and sunblock to those who live in sunny climates.
Dynamic creatives refers to having a few different creatives and
choosing the most appropriate one for the user through some automated
means such as audience segmentation or based on frequency and
recency. Many platforms have rules about how much creatives can vary
within the same [placement](#placement) – for example, there may be limitations on [rotating](#rotating-creative) brands. 

### dynamic pricing

Purchase pricing for an ad impression that is determined via [real-time bidding (RTB)](#real-time-bidding-rtb) rather than a predetermined
rate.

### eCPA

Effective Cost Per Acquisition. This is calculated by dividing your cost
(or revenue) by the number of conversion events. Shows how much is spent
in CPA when payouts are measured using another pricing model.  

### eCPC

Effective Cost Per Click. A translation from CPM, CPC, CPA, and other
pricing models so that they can be compared. Shows how much is spent in
CPC when payouts are measured using another pricing model.   

### eCPM

Effective Cost Per Thousand. A translation from CPM, CPC, CPA , and any
other pricing models so they can be compared. Shows how much is spent in
CPM when payouts are measured using another pricing model.

### engagement metrics

In advertising, engagement metrics are the metrics used to measure
consumers' engagement with the ads they encounter. Engagement metrics
are used by media buyers to gauge the effectiveness of their
advertising. This is most easily done by direct marketers who use CPA
buying strategies, but there are a variety of other ways to measure the
impact of ads via engagement. Some possible engagement metrics include
whether a user has watched an entire video ad, if a user hovers over a
creative with a mouse, and whether a user has clicked on an ad. More
generally, the term engagement metrics may also be applied to a range of
online behaviors, such as how long a visitor spends on a website.

### exchange

See [ad exchange](#ad-exchange).

### expandable ad

Rich media [creatives](#creative) that can be enlarged beyond the initial
dimensions of the [placements](#placement) they fill on web pages.

### first-party cookies

[Cookies](#cookie) that use the domain of the website a user is
currently on. For example, if you visit www.mysite.com and the domain of
the cookie is www.mysite.com, then this is a first-party cookie.
First-party cookies are usually used for login, user experience, and [retargeting](#retargeting) purposes. See also [third-party cookies](#third-party-cookies).

### first-party data

First-party data is information collected directly and stored by
publishers, retailers, brands and other types of companies about their
audiences or customers. 

### first touch

An [attribution](#attribution) model in which gives credit for the first
impression a user saw. This may be used as an alternative to the [last view](#last-view)/[last click](#last-click) model, which gives credit for the last
viewed or clicked ad. 

### flight

The lifetime of a campaign, from its start date to its end date. A
campaign can also have no flight dates and continue indefinitely. A
campaign that is active is said to be "in flight".

### frequency

How often an ad is shown in a certain period, such as a single browsing
session, a 24 hour period or a flight. Advertisers often want to manage
frequency to avoid showing an ad to the same user too often, also known
as overexposure. See also [recency](#recency-capping).

### frequency capping

The act of limiting, or "capping" how often a particular creative can be
served to a user. For example, an advertiser might use frequency capping
to ensure that an ad could be shown to the same user no more than three
times per 24 hours. See also [recency capping](online-advertising-and-ad-tech-glossary.md#recency-capping). It allows brands to guard against
agitating viewers with repeat exposures, by specifying a maximum
threshold for playback.

TV-length (typically 30-60 minutes, sometimes more), and often includes
multiple ad breaks throughout the streaming video content.

### gross average audience (GAA)

The estimate which reflects the sum of all tuning and viewing minutes to
a program. Tuning and viewing to the same minute of a program (or its
repeat telecast) are counted each time.

### gross impressions (IMP)

The GRPs expressed in numeric rather than percent form. Impressions =
GRPs x Universe.

### gross rating point (GRP)

A term used to measure the size of an audience reached by a specific
media vehicle or schedule. It is used to measure the exposure to one or
more programs or commercials, without regard to multiple exposures of
the same advertising to individuals. For example, an advertisement that
is aired/served 5 times reaching 50% of the target audience each time it
is aired would have a GRP of 250 (5 × 50%). GRP values are typically
used by media buyers to compare the advertising strength of various
media vehicles.

### guaranteed inventory

Inventory consisting of impressions sold ahead of time, rather than in a
real-time auction via real-time bidding. Called guaranteed because the
publisher signs a contract with an agency committing to deliver the
specified impressions in exchange for an agreed-upon sum. If the
guarantee is not met, the agency will often request a “make-good,”
usually in the form of a credit. See also [premium](#premium-inventory) inventory.

### household-level targeting

Two households may watch the same show via CTV but may be served
different ads based on various identifiers.

### ID synching

See  [user ID mapping](#user-id-mapping).

### identity graph

An Identity Graph, or ID Graph, is a database that stores all
identifiers that correlate with individual customers. These identifiers
could be anything from usernames to address, email, phone, cookies,

sources of viewer data against which to buy, often compiled from
combining multiple viewer signals, in lieu of on-device identifiers.

### identifier for advertisers (IFA)

A random device identifier assigned by Apple to a user's device.
Advertisers use this to track data so they can deliver customized
advertising. It provides device-level identification whilst giving users
control over information accessed by apps.

### iframe

An HTML iframe tag tells the browser to open a mini browser window of a
specified size inside the current window. This way the ad content cannot
expand beyond the size specified and "take over" the screen.

### impression

A creative served to a single user at a single point in time. Sometimes
called an "imp".

### in-banner video

In-banner video is a type of creative played in a standard banner rather
than in a video player. Any banner placement may accommodate an
in-banner video creative, if allowed by the publisher. 

### in-commerical overlays

A linear TV advertising format that is displayed with a TV commercial. 
This is displayed as a banner overlay that appears 5 seconds after the
ad begins and disappears 5 seconds before it ends. This is clickable to
alternate options such as recording a program, requesting information
about the advertiser, etc..

### in-stream video ad

A video ad that is played before, during or after streaming video
content (Pre-roll, Mid-roll, Post-roll). These ads cannot typically be

The catch-all term for adding a viewer engagement piece to television.
This can include both interactive content and advertising, and can be
delivered in a variety of ways, including through the first- and
second-screen.

### interactive video

A type of digital video creative that can take user input to perform
some enhanced actions through elements integrated above and beyond the
standard video playback controls (i.e., play, pause, rewind, and mute).
These interactions can include varied calls-to-actions, forms,
polls/surveys, links, chapter menus and hot-spots that may affect story
progression of the video content and/or drill down on specific parts of
the content itself. The goal of the creative is to give the user various
options to engage with the message beyond viewing the video.

### interstitial ad

An ad that displays as a user navigates from one web page to the next.
The ad fills the browser window after the user leaves the initial page,
but before the target page displays on the user’s screen.

### internet protocol TV (IPTV)

Whilst all of these methods involve IP, IPTV often refers to programming
delivered over broadband via an internet service provider’s own TV
service, rather than OTT third parties. Operating in a closed circuit
means they cannot communicate with third-party ad servers like other CTV
services, adding operational complexity.

### inventory/supply

The total number of ad views or impressions that are available to sell
over a given period of time. [Publishers](#publisher) sell ad inventory.

### JSON

the advertiser. The landing page may be slightly different from the [click URL](#click-url).

### last click

A type of [attribution](#attribution) model that pays out on the last impression
that was clicked on by the [user](#user). This may be used as an alternative to the [first touch](#first-touch)  model, which gives credit for the first
impression a user saw.

### location data

Anonymous, user-level data collected from a mobile device and that
provides anonymous information about its current position in space.
Location data is typically used to provide foot-traffic attribution,
audience segments for targeting, offline analytics based on the
understanding of consumer offline patterns. It can be 1st, 2nd or 3rd
party data.

### long-tail

Ad inventory with relatively low exposure or limited users, such as a
personal blog with a very low number of followers, or numerous less
desirable users, such as people who are very young, have minimal
disposable income, or other factors that would make them unlikely
consumers of a product or service. The long tail can be difficult to
monetize.

### long-form video

Video content that always has a content arc with a beginning, middle,
and end and that, in its entirety typically lasts longer than 8 minutes
(i.e., movies and original series). If the content is ad supported, it
typically contains breaks (mid-roll). This is different than commercial
videos, which typically put the product upfront and run under one
minute. 

### lookalike model

Used to build larger audiences from smaller segments to create reach for
advertisers. The larger audience reflects the benchmark characteristics
of the original audience. In the context of marketing, lookalike
modelling can be used to reach new prospects that look like a marketer’s
best customers.

impression. Mediation enables access to additional ad networks to
maximize fill rates. There are two main categories of mediation: web
mediation and mobile mediation.  

### mediated ad network

An ad network  that sits outside of RTB auctions for online inventory,
but participates in auctions alongside real-time bidders and direct

like Hulu and Amazon Prime Video, plus virtual multi-platform video
distributors (vMVPDs) like Sling TV and fuboTV.

### owned and operated

A type of publisher that both owns and operates its inventory
sources. Different from a managed publisher, which does not own or
operate its inventory sources, but has a financial relationship with
those who do.

### passback

### PHP session ID

A PHP session allows you to store user information on a server for later
use. However, session information is temporary and will be deleted after
the user has left a website. Sessions work by creating a unique ID (UID)
for each visitor and storing variables based on this UID. The UID is
either stored in a cookie or is propagated in the URL.

### piggyback

This term usually refers specifically to a piggybacked [pixel](#pixel). When pixel A has pixel B piggybacked on to it,
then the firing of pixel A causes the firing of pixel B. This second
firing can either be via a redirect or a server-side firing. Piggyback
pixels may be used for tracking conversions in secondary systems. 

### PII

See [personally identifiable information](#personally-identifiable-information-pii). 

### pixel

A pixel is a way to track user data. Originally, all pixels were
literally snippets of code that called for a 1X1 transparent pixel to be
delivered to a webpage by a third-party server. Nowadays, pixels may
either be literal pixels or be javascript based. When the pixel loads,
the third-party server can record information such as the IP address of
the user's computer, URL of the page, and time the page was viewed. See
also [conversion pixel](#conversion-pixel) and [segment pixel](#segment-pixel).

The term "premium" can be used in different ways, but it most commonly
refers to publisher inventory that is sold through direct channels in
advance – in other words, [guaranteed](online-advertising-and-ad-tech-glossary.md#guaranteed-inventory) inventory. Often premium inventory is from a
site's home page, or has some other elevated level of desirability. See
also [remnant inventory](online-advertising-and-ad-tech-glossary.md#remnant-inventory).

### premnant inventory

A portmanteau word of premium + remnant. "[remnant inventory](#remnant-inventory)," or non-[guaranteed](#guaranteed-inventory)  inventory has an unnecessarily negative
connotation when this inventory might be first-rate.

### private marketplace

Invitation-only marketplaces where premium publishers make their
inventory and audience available to select buyers, often times
transacted through the use of Deal IDs.

### probabilistic data

Inferred or modelled data that identifies an audience that has a high
probability of being a particular consumer.

### probabilistic ID

Inferred audience profiles modelled based on previous behaviour and
statistical analysis, risking imprecision when compared with
deterministic IDs.

### programmatic

The automated buying and selling of inventory.

### programmatic buying

Buying through automated means, for example, by setting up a campaign in
an RTB exchange or other automated system. This is opposed to more
manual buys where you are in contact with a sales team, or other

serve if there are no acceptable bids on a piece of inventory and the
publisher does not have a [default creative](#default-creativereserve-creative) set. 

### publisher

A source of inventory. Publishers are generally either managed or owned
and operated. An owned and operated publisher receives 100% of the
profit for impressions sold. This is opposed to a managed publisher: a
publisher that does not own its inventory but has a financial
relationship with those who do.

### publisher click-tracking

When a publisher keeps track of clicks on their ads. If a publisher is
being paid on a  [CPC](#cpc) basis and wants to track clicks, they can provide
[click-tracking URL](#click-url) where it is possible to ping them
each time a user clicks on an ad. 

### query string

A way to pass data to a web application as part of a URL. For example,
at Xandr a buyer can target ads based on the
information in the querystring. The query string comes after a "?" in
the URL, for example:

`http://www.mysite.com/photos?query_string=17`

### rating %

a television program or commercial at least once across a stated period
of time. Also called the cumulative (cume) or unduplicated audience.
During the course of the schedule shown in the illustration above, seven
different households were exposed to the commercial at least once. Since
each home represents 10% of the universe, this makes the reach or cume
70%.

### real-time advertising

advertiser might want to avoid showing an ad to a specific [user ID](#unique-user-id) more than once per hour.

### retargeting

[Targeting](#ad-targeting) users who have performed an action in the
past, who may therefore be more likely to perform the same or a similar
task in the future. For example, an advertiser might wish to put a [segment pixel](#segment-pixel) on their website and then target users
who have visited the website in the past because they are more likely to
make a purchase.

### remnant inventory

Inventory sold after [premium inventory](#premium-inventory) has been pre-sold by a direct
salesforce. Remnant inventory is sometimes synonymous with real-time
inventory, and is often the target of programmatic buying. Because
remnant has an unnecessarily negative connotation, other terms that have
been experimented with are "premnant" (premium + remnant} or "secondary
premium." Also sometimes called "tier 2" or "class 2."

### reporting

In ad tech, reporting data for both buyers and sellers, such as
audiences reached, effective cost, money spent, impressions seen,

therefore be more likely to perform the same or a similar task in the
future. For example, an advertiser might wish to put a segment pixel on
their website and then target users who have visited the website in the
past because they are more likely to make a purchase.

### return path data (RPD)

TV tuning data that comes from set-top boxes in cable and satellite
subscribers’ homes. It can include information like the programs
subscribers watch, when they watch them and where the subscriber
households are located. This data helps enable audience measurement and
addressable advertising capabilities.

### rich media

Ads with which users can interact (as opposed to solely animation) in a
web page format that are more elaborate than the usual banner ad. Often
has non-standard characteristics such larger than ~40k, out-of-banner
(OOB) behavior, features like "post to Facebook," plays video within a
banner, or in-creative metrics collection. Expandable creatives are
examples of rich media creatives.  

### rising stars

A set of interactive rich media creative types defined by the [Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB)](#interactive-advertising-bureau-iab). They include
Billboard, Filmstrip, Slider, Portrait, Pushdown, and Sidekick. There is

much creatives may vary when associated to a single tag. For example,
Xandr bans a single tag from showing ads for
multiple brands. See also [dynamic creative](#dynamic-creative). 

### RTB

See [real-time bidding](#real-time-bidding-rtb)

## S-Z

### second party data

your own audience. It could include data from many of the same sources
first-party data comes from.

### second price auction

An auction type in which the bidder who submitted the highest bid pays a
price equal to the second-highest bid. Also known as a Vickrey auction.
This auction type has been in use for over a century for the purchase

segment pixel on the homepage and mark all visitors to the homepage as
"homepage visitors."

### semantic targeting

In theory, semantic targeting means figuring out what the content on a
webpage is really about and being able to place ads based on that
content. For example, if a website says "sunny weather," is it about
great beach vacations, or is it about skin cancer, and do you want to
advertise flights to Florida on it or not? However, the term is often
used by different people to mean slightly different things, and is often
used to be synonymous with [contextual](#contextual-data) targeting.

### server-side ad insertion (SSAI)

Ads are delivered by publishers in the content stream itself, rather
than called separately by viewing devices. Increases ad delivery speed,
but reduces buyers’ visibility into campaign performance.

### share (of audience)

### supply side platform (SSP)

Software used by publishers to aggregate, consolidate, and manage
available demand sources and exchange inventory.

### tag

A snippet of HTML, generally either JavaScript or an IFRAME, that tells
the browser to request some content from an ad server. Tag is often
used to mean an [ad tag](#ad-tag) but may also be a creative tag or some other
kind of tag. A tag is provided by an ad server or exchange and placed in
the webpage by a publisher.

### tag container

Many advertisers and their media buyers use a number of
[tags](#tag) for tracking impressions, clicks, conversions, and
other data. Some use tag containers to manage these disparate pixel tags
and make it easier to change them via a single source. When a page
loads, the tag container code displays the code for all tags stored
within the container.

### targeting

See [ad targeting](#ad-targeting). 

### technology providers

Third-party entities who may assist various parties involved in Internet
advertising by providing access to bidders or other technology.

### third party data

Third-party data is data that can be bought from outside sources that
are not the original collectors of that data. Instead, large data
aggregators pull data from various platforms and websites where it was
generated. Essentially, aggregators pay publishers and other data owners
for their 1st-party data, collect it into one large data set and sell it
as 3rd-party data.

### third-party cookies

Cookies with a different domain than the website a user is currently on.
For example, if you visit [www.mysite.com](http://www.mysite.com/), an Xandr

and [attribution](#attribution). For example, at
Xandr, the timestamp format is YYYY-MM-DD
HH:MM:SS. In this format, 12:15 PM on New Year's Day 2015 would be
2015-01-01 12:15:00. 

### trading desk

A buy-side trading entity housed within or working for advertising
agencies. Also known as an agency trading desk or ATD. ATDs are usually
the programmatic arms of holding companies. Independent trading desks,
known as ITDs, are another kind of trading desk, and are usually
outsourced managed services firms that run programmatic ad buys on
behalf of
[advertisers](#advertiser) or agencies.

### TV everywhere

An online business model in which television broadcasters, particularly
cable networks, allow their customers to access live and/or on-demand
video content from their networks through internet-based services. The
fee for such access is covered as part of their subscription to the
service, via an MVPD. The viewers use credentials from their MVPD for
authentication and access to the content either through the cable
providers app/website or a network's own app/website.

### transactional Video On Demand (TVOD)

TVOD is an [OTT](#over-the-top-ott) service that provides streaming video on a
pay-as-you-view basis. It is a digital manifestation of pay-per-view
(PPV), that enable one-off purchases and often time-limited access.
Apple's iTunes on Apple TV is a prime example.

### UGC

See [user-generated content](#user-generated-content-ugc).

### uniques

Individual users, as represented by a [unique user ID](#unique-user-id). A unique user ID is not associated in
any way with [personally identifiable information](#personally-identifiable-information-pii) (PII), so it cannot
identify a specific unique individual. Also, an individual may be
associated with multiple user IDs due to clearing browser cookies or
using multiple browsers and multiple devices. Additionally, for mobile
devices, a unique user ID may be associated with multiple device IDs
(for example,  Apple IDFA, OpenUDID, and others). See [reach](#reach)to learn more about individual users/user IDs.

### unique app identifier

The mechanism through which devices allow apps to pass user identifiers
to audiences. Historically unavailable to CTV apps and, therefore,
buyers.

### unique user

Individual users, as represented by a unique user ID. A unique user ID
is not associated in any way with personally identifiable information
(PII), so it cannot identify a specific unique individual. Also, an
individual may be associated with multiple user IDs due to clearing
browser cookies or using multiple browsers and multiple devices.
Additionally, for mobile devices, a unique user ID may be associated
with multiple device IDs (for example, Apple IDFA, OpenUDID, and
others). See reach to learn more about individual users/user IDs.

### unique user ID

Also sometimes called a UUID. A unique, anonymous user ID for a given
user profile that may be stored in a user's browser cookie and/or in the
a server-side cookie store. Ad traffickers are not permitted to
associate these IDs in any way with [personally identifiable information](#personally-identifiable-information-pii) (PII), and user IDs
do not necessarily equate to a unique individual. An individual may also
be associated with multiple user IDs due to clearing cookies or using
multiple browsers and multiple devices. Additionally, for mobile
devices, a unique user ID may be associated with multiple device IDs
(for example, Apple IDFA, OpenUDID, etc.). 

### universe estimate (UE)

Total persons or homes in a given population.

### user

A target customer for advertisers. The person browsing the web who will
see an ad.

### user agent

This usually refers to a browser application. For example, Mozilla 5.0
is a specific user agent.

### user data

Information about [users](#user) that makes them more valuable to advertisers.
User data can include age, gender, location, intent to purchase,
demographics, psychographics, wealth, past purchases, and more. User
data is generally associated with a [UUID](#uuid) found in a cookie rather than any [personally identifiable information](#personally-identifiable-information-pii). User data is
distinct from [contextual data](#contextual-data). Often used interchangeably with
segment data and audience data.

### user data store

A place where data about a user is stored. In online advertising, this
often refers to a user's browser cookie. Sometimes, certain user data
may be stored server-side for a limited period of time. This data is
periodically expunged from server records in order to prevent it from
drastically slowing server function, and does not contain [personally identifiable information (PII)](#personally-identifiable-information-pii). 

### user-generated content (UGC)

Content on a website that was posted by users and not a centralized
publisher. This includes social media posts as well as blogs, wikis,
podcasting, images, videos, audio files, and other forms of media
created and posted by users of an online system or service. Some sites
support user content through advertising. Others are supported by
donations, subscription fees, or a combination of methods. Examples of
sites that emphasize or are built around user-generated content include
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Wikipedia, YouTube, Vine, and
SoundCloud. 

### user ID

See [unique user ID](#unique-user-id). 

### user ID mapping

Each buyer and seller may assign their own different IDs to a user.
Without knowing that Seller S's user ABC is the same as Buyer B's user
1234, it is impossible for B to value an impression from S. To allow for
attribution and valuation, different parties must synchronize their IDs
by mapping one ID to another. For example, Xandr
assigns every user it sees a unique ID that's stored in the user's
browser cookie. The Xandr member or bidder maps
the Xandr ID to their internal user ID with the
Xandr User ID Mapping Service. Also known as
user ID synching.

### user sync pixel

A pixel used to synchronize user IDs assigned by different parties
during an auction, generally to apply frequency, recency, and other
decisioning data. See also [user ID mapping](#user-id-mapping).

### UUID

See [unique user ID](#unique-user-id).

### VAST

Video Ad Serving Template. A framework for serving ads to a video
player. The specification also describes expected player behavior for
executing ads that are supplied using VAST. The interaction between the
ad and the player is unidirectional, meaning that once the player
receives the VAST tag no other interactions are possible except for the
activation of select tracking beacons at appropriate times during ad
playback. For details, see the [Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) VAST documentation](https://www.iab.com/).

### vendor

Refers to a company with a specific product or service such as creating
or delivering rich media, maintaining a CDN, or providing third-party
data.

### video ad completion

When a video ad starts and plays through its entire duration to
completion.

### video ad completion rate

The percentage of all video ads that play through their entire duration
to completion. Also known as View Through Rate (VTR) and Video
Completion Rate (VCR). Not to be confused with the videocassette
recorder.

### video level meta-data

Information about a video that is comprised by analyzing its text,
images, and content. This meta-data is utilized to categorize and
describe video content to ultimately help users search for videos and
help marketers with contextual targeting efforts.

### video on demand (VOD)

Video content that is viewed after its official release date or original
air date and time. VOD content can be found on set top boxes, desktop,
mobile and connected TV. It is consumers’ ability to select and view
shows at a time of their choosing that has revolutionised consumption.
In the UK, for example, just 46% of viewing was attributed to live TV in
April 2020.

### video quartiles

A quartile is 1/4 of something. Media players fire a series of
engagement pixels as the video continues to play. These pixels typically
indicate how many quartiles of a video has been played, firing at 25%,
50%, 75%, and 100% completion.

### vCPM

Cost per mille, or thousand, viewable impressions (mille = thousand in
Latin). A pricing model in which advertisers pay for every 1000 viewable
impressions of their advertisement served. Viewability refers to whether
an impression was actually seen by the user, and can be determined
according to a variety of methods.

### VMAP

Video Multiple Ad Playlist (VMAP) specification. a framework for serving
ads to a video player. The specification also describes expected player
behavior for executing ads that are supplied using vast. The interaction
between the ad and the player is unidirectional, meaning that once the
player receives the vast tag no other interactions are possible except
for the activation of select tracking beacons at appropriate times
during ad playback. Provides a standardized method for communicating the
status of a video ad back to the ad servers in the case where the ad is
served from a dynamically selected ad server. It is specifically
designed for on-demand video player where the ad response is parsed
prior to play. Vast is applicable to linear video ads (such as
pre-rolls), non-linear video ads (such as overlays) and companion ads as
defined in the IAB digital video ad format guidelines.

### virtual MVPD (vMVPD)

New form of digital-only cable alternative which provides access to
on-demand and live content delivered over the internet without the
traditional network infrastructure (i.e. Direct TV Now, Sling TV, Sony
PlayStation Vue).

### VPAID

The protocol between the ad and the video player required to enable ad
interactivity and other advanced video advertising functionality. VPAID
offers bilateral (two-way) communication between the ad and the video
player, and meets the needs of emerging in-stream formats such as
nonlinear video ads and interactive linear video ads.

### vendor

In online advertising, a vendor generally refers to a company with a
specific product or service such as creating or delivering rich media,
maintaining a [CDN](#cdn), or providing third-party data.

### viewability

A measure of whether an ad has been seen by a given user. Viewability
measurement is achieved using javascript embedded within each creative,
which is then called for each individual ad impression. The script
launches automatically as the page loads and immediately starts
measuring if and when the creative is viewable based on a variety of
measures. These may include whether a web or browser tab is in focus,
whether a particular ad is in view of a user based on where on the page
the user has scrolled to, how long an ad was visible based on these
metrics, and other factors. The most commonly used bidding strategy
based on viewability is [CPVM](#cpvm). In 2015, the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB)
released industry standards for viewability. To learn more, see the
[IAB website](https://www.iab.com/). 

### viewability rate

The percentage of video ad impressions that were deemed viewable as per
the video viewability definition of the measurement vendor. 

### viewable video impression

A desktop video ad or mobile video ad that meets the criteria of:

- **Desktop**: 50% of the ad’s pixels on an in-focus browser tab in the
  viewable space of the browser page that has met the time criterion
  that two continuous seconds of the video advertisement is played.
- **Mobile**: 50% of the ad’s pixels on an in-focus browser or a fully
  downloaded, opened, initialized application, on the viewable space of
  the device that has met the time criterion that two continuous seconds
  of the video advertisement is played.
- For both desktop video and mobile video, the required time is not
  necessarily the first two seconds of the video ad; any unduplicated
  content of the ad comprising two continuous seconds qualifies in this
  regard.

### walled gardens

Walled gardens do not allow open access to data or allow access to be
served through a third-party ad tech infrastructure. They rigorously
gather and protect valuable customer data to build strong, personal
connections with users across their networks, and can stop other brands
from accessing that information.

### weighted average

Calculated by multiplying each program's rating by its duration, summing
these products and dividing the total by the sum of the duration.

### web mediation

Mediation that takes place over the Web. Web mediation involves
trafficking an ad network’s tags. The tags are called when the seller
ranks the networks proxy bid higher than any other demand. If the buyer
doesn’t take the impression, a passback tag set up by the seller informs
the ad network to go to the next highest bidder or ad network.

### yield management

Broadly, this term refers to selling the right things to the right
customer at the right time for the right price to maximize revenue. In
online advertising, it generally refers to maximizing the revenue of
publishers and their impressions using tools such as price floors.
