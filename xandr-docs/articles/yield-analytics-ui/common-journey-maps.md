# Common journey maps
A journey map is the path a user takes from problem to solution by using yield analytics. Some common journey maps are:

- Dealing with campaign under-delivery
  - Understand what’s competing now, and in the future.
  - Understand how capacity impacts delivery.
  - Look at consumption patterns by priority (with reporting). This is to understand opportunity and affected order lines for any changes.
- Fulfilling a proposed campaign
  - Quickly and efficiently pull available impressions by product for any timeframe and priority level.
  - Understand how to pull availability for custom products that do not yet exist in your ad server.
  - Find relevant products to address oversell situations.
- Pricing a proposed campaign
  - Understand historical and future pricing trends.
  - Find historical pricing for any combination of `advertiser/agency/industry/contract` type - to understand
    pricing for unique situations.
