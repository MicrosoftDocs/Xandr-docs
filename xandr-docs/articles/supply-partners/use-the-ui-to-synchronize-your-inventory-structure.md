# Use the UI to synchronize your inventory structure

This page shows you how to use the UI to map your supply to the corresponding Xandr objects. Please follow these instructions for each publisher you work with.

To map your supply using the API, see [Use the API to Synchronize Your Inventory Structure](use-the-api-to-synchronize-your-inventory-structure.md).

## Before you begin

Before you begin, you must meet the following criteria:

- You are familiar with the [Sell-Side Object Hierarchy](understanding-the-sell-side-object-hierarchy.md).
- You have worked with Xandr to create a [global ad quality profile](define-ad-quality-rules.md) to control which creatives can appear on your publishers' inventory.

## Step 1. Create a publisher

Only the features relevant to Supply Partners are covered. Please ignore other features not mentioned here.

1. Go to **Publisher** > **All Publishers**.

1. Click **Create Publisher**. This opens the  **Create New Publisher** dialog.

1. Enter the following **Publisher Details**:
    - In the **Name** field, enter the name of the legal entity of the company you pay money to. For instance, if you buy from `espn.com`, the publisher should be named as the legal entity for ESPN.
    - In the **Status** dropdown, select **Active**.
    - In the **Affiliation** dropdown, select **Owned and Operated**.
    - In the **Currency** field, select the primary currency used by the publisher.
    - Open **Advanced Options** and enter the ID of the publisher from your own system in the **Code** field. In Bid Requests, you will pass this code in the `ext_pub_code` field.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > Using the **Code** field is highly recommended at both the publisher and placement levels to ensure that your inventory is as granular as possible so that it can be investigated accurately for quality issues, and specifically for domain detectability. While not required, this step will help you to split your inventory into highly detectable and less detectable tags, allowing you to isolate the impacts of non-detectable domains on the rest of your inventory's viability.

1. On the **Exposure Settings** tab, select how much information you want Xandr to expose to buyers when reselling the publisher's placements. The more information you expose, the easier it is for buyers to target the resold inventory.
    - **Expose domains for reporting** - Check this box if you want to let buyers that purchase your inventory see the domains associated with the purchased impressions in reporting.
    - **Expose for reselling** - Check this box if you want to let buyers see the individual publisher in campaign targeting and buyer reports. If you check this, you can determine a **Reselling Name** and a **Description**. If you do not enter a **Reselling Name**, the name of the publisher will be exposed.

1. On the **Ad Quality** tab, leave the default selection, **Only Apply Network Profile**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > During your initial integration, you should have worked with Xandr to create a global ad quality profile to control which creatives can appear on your publisher's inventory. This default selection applies that global ad quality profile to your publisher. If you need to control ad quality on a publisher-by-publisher basis, please reach out to your Xandr representative.

1. Click **Save**.

## Step 2. Check the default placement group

When you create a publisher, we automatically create a placement group for the publisher's placements. If all of the inventory from the publisher is for one type of supply (**Standard Websites**, **Mobile-Optimized Websites**, or **Mobile Application**), you don't need to create any additional placement groups; you simply need to edit the placement group and make sure the correct supply type is selected:

1. Select the placement group and click Full Edit.

1. Select the correct **Supply Type.**

    :::image type="content" source="media/75798776.jpg" alt-text="A screenshot that shows how to select the supply type for a placement group on the UI.":::

1. Click **Save**.

## Step 3. Create placements

For each of the publisher's placements, follow the steps below. Note that only the features relevant to Supply Partners are covered, as well as some features that are not generally recommended but may be useful in some situations. Please ignore other features not mentioned here.

### Working with domain detection

> [!TIP]
> In order to improve your experience with Domain Detection, it's best practice to break your new inventory into new placements if you're able to do so. In the event of potentially problematic inventory or tags coming through a publisher, more granular inventory grouping and better labeling gives you the ability to isolate the impact of tags at high risk of being deactivated while protecting the rest of your inventory from impact.
>
> However, creating new placements to work with Domain Detection is optional. If you choose not to do this, you can simply use the default placement that was created when the publisher was saved. Just be sure to set an `ext_pub_code` to be sent with your bid requests at the publisher level. This can be done via the **Code** field in the publisher's advanced options (see above).

1. Go to **Publishers** > **Placement Manager**.

1. Select the placement group into which you want to assign the placement and then click **Create New** > **Placement**.

    This opens the **Create New Placement** dialog.

1. Enter the following **Placement Details**:
    - In the **Name** field, enter a logical name that corresponds to the inventory .
    - The **State** field is set to **Active** by default. If you do not want the placement to be active once it's saved, select **Inactive**. Note that if you try to serve an impression on an inactive placement, the impression will be blank.
    - Check **Enable this placement for reselling to other platform members**. Although this setting will soon be unnecessary, it is important that you set it currently.
    - Click **+ Code (Advanced)** and enter the ID of the placement from your own system in the **Code** field. In Bid Requests, you will pass this code in the `ext_pub_code` field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Using the **Code** field is required at both the publisher and placement levels to ensure that your inventory is as granular as possible so that it can be investigated accurately for quality issues, and specifically for domain detectability. While not required, this step will help you to split your inventory into highly detectable and less detectable tags, allowing you to isolate the impacts of non-detectable domains on the rest of your inventory's viability.

1. In the **Allowed Media** and **Size** sections, leave the default selections. These details are passed in your bid request and don't need to be set here.

1. On the **Content Categories** tab, Xandr recommends that you do not apply any universal or custom content categories unless you have familiarity and relationships with buyers who will want to target very specific categories of inventory.

1. On the **Self-Audit Settings** tab, you can self-classify the placement for sensitive attributes and intended audience. Your advertisers and buyers who trust your self-audit can target these settings in their campaigns. Xandr may also audit this inventory if it meets volume thresholds.

1. Click **Save**.

## Step 4. Test the mapping setup (optional)

You can test that the mapping is working correctly by using a debug auction. Send a test impression to our endpoint with the debug parameters and check that the impression reaches the expected placement.
