# Data Sharing



Data providers can expose their segments to data buyers by participating
in the Xandr Data Provider program  (contact
your Xandr representative for more
information) or using the Member Data Sharing Service for real-time data
providers (if you have a bidder) or the Member Data Sharing Service for

Note: Xandr
does not permit clients to share segments with third parties until the
data provider has signed our data access agreement. Clients may share
first-party data if they have multiple member IDs under the same company
on our platform. Please contact your Xandr
representative if interested in signing the data access agreement.
