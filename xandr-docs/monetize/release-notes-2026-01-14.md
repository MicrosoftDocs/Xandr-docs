# Deal Sync Status available in the new Deal screen  

**Release date:** January 14, 2026  
**Product:** Microsoft Monetize  
**Area:** Deals  

Deal Sync Status is now available in the **new Deal screen**, providing sellers with visibility into whether a deal has successfully synchronized with supported DSPs, including **Display & Video 360 (DV360)** and **The Trade Desk (TTD)**.

Sellers can view the sync status under the **Buyer** column in the Deal screen. For single-buyer deals, the status appears directly in the grid, while for multi-buyer deals, buyer-specific details are available in the **Settings** side pane. Sync status is not shown for deals targeted to the entire DSP. **It’s also possible to filter deals by sync status using the Filters at the top of the Deal screen next to the search bar.**

Available sync statuses include **Syncing**, **Syncing Error**, **Pending**, **Accepted**, **Targeted** (TTD only), **Archived**, and **Declined**.

This update improves transparency into deal readiness, reduces activation delays, and minimizes the need for manual validation through support or buyer outreach.
