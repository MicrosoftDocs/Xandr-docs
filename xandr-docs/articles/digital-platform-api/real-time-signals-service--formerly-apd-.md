# **Real-Time Signals Service (Formerly APD)**





class="note warning note_warning">

<b>Warning:</b>

- The Real-Time Signals Service is in Beta, and is subject to change in
  the future.
- As we transition to open beta, **we will be adding a monthly charge
  for new and existing clients that use RTSS**. For more information,
  please speak to your account manager.





The following guide is meant to help users create segments using the
Real-Time Signals Service (RTSS). RTSS enables segment creation and
targeting based on real-time signals such as open location codes, URLs,
or IP addresses. It is a scalable, consentless alternative to
cookie-based audience targeting.

>

RTSS is especially valuable under the following conditions:

- **GDPR and the Demise of Third-Party Cookies.** With tightening
  privacy regulations and increased scrutiny around user data
  collection, in addition to ad-blocking, reliance on cookies and other
  device IDs will become increasingly difficult in the foreseeable
  future.
- **CTV and the Cookie-less Environment.** There is no universal or
  persistent standard for device identification for CTV. The CTV
  ecosystem is dominated by a handful of "walled gardens." As a result,
  advertisers and their agencies must work directly with each and every
  device maker/platform, or buy through PMP.



By providing unique targeting capabilities in a cookie-less environment,
along with supply from the Xandr exchange, RTSS can be a key
differentiator for buying, selling, and curation:

- **Publishers:** For publishers and their DMPs, RTSS provides a viable
  alternative to onboard/monetize their 1P audience based off contextual
  signals, in a secure, privacy compliant way.
- **Curators:** For curators, RTSS enables them to create context-based
  audiences using alternative signals. They can then pair these unique
  audience data with supply from the Xandr exchange to create media
  products and then sold through deals to any DSP.
- **Buyers:** For buyers, RTSS enable them to create their own or access
  to premium publishers' audiences and target in cookie-less
  environment, such as CTV.

## **Bugs and Breaking Changes**

- Beta status means that we release and update features frequently in
  response to the feedback we receive from participants in the beta
  program. You can expect to experience a few hiccups, and your team
  should have a strategy that takes into account occasional issues with
  the platform.
- Our standard <a
  href="breaking-changes.md"
  class="xref" target="_blank">Breaking Change</a> notification policies
  and timelines also do not apply to this beta feature. Make sure you
  monitor all communication from Xandr in regard to this beta, and be
  prepared to modify your implementations to accommodate changes.
