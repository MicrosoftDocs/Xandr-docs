Monetize Ad Server and third-party ad server publishers can both use Native Assembly.-->

## Native assembly for Microsoft Monetize ad server publishers

Microsoft Monetize Ad Server publishers can use Native Assembly on the client side where Microsoft Advertising's seller tag (AST) and mobile SDKs for Android and iOS can be leveraged. With Native Assembly, Microsoft Monetize Ad Server publishers can:

- Access a gallery of high impact templates and personalize them using HTML, CSS, and/or Javascript.
- use custom native assets to enhance their users' experience.
- set custom price floors for their main image and video assets.

## Native assembly for third-Party ad server publishers

Third-party ad server publishers can use Native Assembly on the server side. Since third-party ad server publishers do not have access to Microsoft Advertising's seller tag (AST) and mobile SDKs for Android and iOS, their Native Assembly renderers are applied on the server side. With Native Assembly, third-party ad server publishers can:

- expose native inventory to buyers.
- render native inventory that matches their asset specifications to create native assemblies.
