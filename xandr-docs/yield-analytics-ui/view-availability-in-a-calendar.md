# View availability in a calendar

You can view daily availability in a calendar for a given month, to find openings for new deals. This is especially useful for sponsorships.

To view the calendar:

1. On the **Availability Dashboard** page, in the **Availability Tasks** panel, select **View Calendar**. The **View Calendar** page appears.
1. In the **Filter** panel on the left side of the page, in the **Configuration** section, select how you want availability to be displayed:
    1. In the **Show Availability As** list, choose to see availability as a percentage of available impressions or as the number of available impressions.
    1. In the **Availability Based On** list, choose whether you want to see availability based on all order lines, or only order lines in sponsorship/exclusive campaigns.
    1. In the **Consumption Type** list, choose whether you want to see availability based on consumption type (Contained, Direct, and Indirect).
    1. On the **Colors** slider, determine the percentages you want to use to determine whether a date is available for booking. The calendar shows you at a glance the dates that meet these percentages as follows:
       - Dates displayed in green are available for booking.
       - Dates displayed in yellow have some inventory available for booking.
       - Dates displayed in red are unavailable for booking.
1. In the **Filter** panel on the left side of the page, in the **Lookup Criteria** section, select the product groups, products, and targeting you want to use for lookup. For example, you may want to choose a product group for sponsorships only and targeting for a particular demographic. As soon as you choose a product, the calendar view is populated accordingly and is refreshed automatically as you change your criteria (e.g., if you add targeting). By default, availability is displayed for the current month. You can change this using the month filter on the calendar toolbar. Mouse over a date to see a summary of availability. This includes capacity, availability, and sell-through information, as well as the number of booked, pending, and proposed order lines.
1. To see the full details for a particular date, select that date on the calendar. The page is redisplayed in a table (also referred to as the list view) with the date you selected expanded by default.

## Switch between calendar and list views

The **View Calendar** page can be displayed in two views:

- A calendar view that shows a graphical high-level overview of each day on the selected month's calendar.
- A list view that shows the month in a table where each row can be expanded to drill down for detailed information for a given day.

To switch from the calendar view (default) to the list view, select the calendar toolbar.

To switch from the list view to the calendar view, select the calendar toolbar.
