# Find and View a List of Products



You can search across a list of products and drill down to see details.

1.  On the Products Dashboard page, in the Products Tasks panel,
    click Find Products. The Find
    Products page is displayed. By default, the product list is filtered
    to show active rate card products.
2.  In the Filter panel on the left side of the page, narrow the product
    list by selecting options in the fields provided. As you make your
    filter selections, the product list is redisplayed accordingly.
    - Under Configuration, select the time period for the product
      metrics you want to see.
    - Under Refine By, select the product group(s), product type(s),
      parent product(s), overlapping product(s), creation time
      period(s), and/or product status(es) for the products you want to
      see. If you select more than one option in
      a Refine By field (e.g., if you
      select two product types), you can mouse over the field to see a
      tooltip that lists your selections.
3.  In the search box in the toolbar above the product list, type a
    search term. Change the search options as needed. Press Enter. The
    product list is redisplayed to show only the products that match
    your search criteria.  
    - By default, the search returns products that contain the search
      term you entered. To change the type of search, on the drop-down
      list to the left of the search box, select a different option
      (e.g., to search for products that starts with the search term you
      typed, select Starts With).
    - By default, the search is run against the product name, ID, target
      expression, and target ID. To narrow the search to just one ot
      these, on the drop-down list to the right of the search box,
      select a different option (e.g., to search for products by product
      name only, select Product).
4.  To drill into the high-level details of a product, click the plus
    sign to the left of the product name. The product row is expanded to
    show the product type, status, and more.
