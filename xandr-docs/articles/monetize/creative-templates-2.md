# Creative Templates



If you want to customize the way creatives render, you can create your
own templates from scratch, or you can copy
Xandr standard templates and modify them to fit
your needs.

Our platform supports common creative types such as videos and banners,
as well as increasingly pervasive rich media types such as interstitials
and expandables. For each type of creative, a standard creative template
is provided that ensures proper rendering on web pages when creatives
are served. You can examine the rendering code and the macros used in
these standard creative templates, but you cannot edit them.

Creating your own custom templates gives you complete control of the
JavaScript and XML rendering code. You can also define macros to prompt
your buyers to enter information and make decisions about the behavior
of the creative during upload. You can create up to 100 custom
templates.



<b>Note:</b> Xandr
does not provide support for creatives that do not render correctly as a
result of errors in the custom template code.
