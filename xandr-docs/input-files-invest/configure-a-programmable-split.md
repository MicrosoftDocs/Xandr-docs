# Configure a Programmable Split



You can use programmable splits to refine line item targeting and
dynamically adjust bids, budget allocation, and creative allocation
across a line item's targeted inventory. Splits are recommended if you
have sophisticated targeting requirements.


When you create an

title="You create augmented line items (ALIs) to define your financial relationship with an advertiser, set up targeting for an advertising campaign, and schedule your advertisements to run.">augmented
line item (ALI)</a>, you also have the option to split up its inventory
using **programmable splits**. Splits allow you to:

- Target different subsections of inventory that match the line item's
  more general criteria
- Dynamically adjust bids based on targeting
- Allocate the line item budget to different targets
- Distribute creatives across the line item's targeted inventory

You define a split by specifying the inventory you want available for
it, using any combination of split settings. These include geography,
inventory performance, and segment information. If you choose, you can
also specify bidding or valuation rules, budget allocations, bidding
priority, and/or creative selection for each split. For more background
information on how splits work, see
<a href="understanding-splits.md" class="xref">Understanding
Splits</a>.





<b>Note:</b> Split changes are only applied
when you click Review and Save on the
line item.
