# Manage Network Priorities



The Network Priorities screen
(Network 
\>  Tools  \>
 Network Priorities) allows you
to set priorities that guide line item and campaign setup. Specifically,
you can change your network priorities settings to enable minimum margin
settings in line item revenue trafficking and campaign buying
strategies.



Important:

This network-wide setting should be enabled when you have made a
business decision to prioritize margin (the profit margin on booked
revenue) on managed campaigns for all line items on the network over
delivery (the frequency and number of campaigns served) on managed
publishers.

To learn about how to set up minimum margin on the line item, see
<a href="create-a-standard-line-item.html" class="xref">Create a
Standard Line Item</a>.



To make changes to your Network Priorities settings

1.  In the Network tab, in the
    Tools menu, select
    Network Priorities. This takes you
    to the Network Priorities screen.
2.  On the Network Priorities screen,
    in the For campaigns targeting direct
    inventory dropdown, the default setting is
    Always bid. As the name suggests,
    this choice prioritizes delivery on managed publishers over margin
    on your managed campaigns. If you want to prioritize making margin
    on your managed campaigns, select Only
    bid if margin is met.
3.  Once you have made your selection, click
    Save to save your changes.

Next Steps

Now you can set minimum margin during
<a href="create-a-standard-line-item.html" class="xref">creation of a
standard line item</a>, under Tracking
Revenue Type. This effectively sets a bid cap on your campaigns.
For your campaigns targeting direct inventory, you can also choose to do
a minimum margin check as part of the
<a href="create-a-campaign.html" class="xref">campaign creation</a>
process to ensure they do not serve on publishers that are not
profitable for your line items.
