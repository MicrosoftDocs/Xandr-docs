# Integrating your data

There are several steps to integrating your data. The typical data
provider integration involves the following process:

1. The data provider and Xandr enter into an
    agreement consisting of a mutual non-disclosure agreement and a data
    licensing agreement.
1. Xandr and the data provider meet to discuss
    and determine the details of the integration between the two
    systems.
1. The data provider gives Xandr a business
    development contact. This information is provided to
    Xandr UI clients in the Help Center within
    Xandr.
1. You data is then integrated. This process is determined largely by
    the type of data being integrated. See the following pages for
    details:
