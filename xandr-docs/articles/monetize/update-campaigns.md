# Update campaigns

You can take several actions on campaigns to update them, including
editing, delete, duplicating, and activating.

## Editing a campaign

You can edit a campaign directly from the
**Campaigns** screen. Hover over the row
for the campaign you want to edit and then click the pencil icon that
appears in the row.

In addition, you can click the row of the campaign you want to edit to
expose the **Campaign Summary** pane. From
there, you can edit targeting and creatives, or click the pencil icon
next to the campaign name to be taken to the full
**Edit Campaign** screen.

## Editing lifetime and daily budgets

You can edit both lifetime and daily budgets for one or more campaigns
directly from the **Campaigns** screen.
Click the pencil and paper icon at the top of either the
**Lifetime Budget** or
**Daily Budget** column to expose the
column editing options.

> [!NOTE]
> The bulk edit option is currently not available through Microsoft Internet Explorer. If you would like to access this feature, please use another browser.

This exposes the **Edit Daily Budget** or
**Edit Lifetime Budget** column, where you
can modify budgets and save your changes.

## Bulk editing flight dates

You can edit the flight dates of one or more campaigns directly from the
**Campaigns** screen. Check the checkbox
for each campaign whose flight dates you wish to edit then click
**Actions** \> **Change Flight Dates**. You
can edit both start and/or end dates for all the campaigns selected in
the **Bulk Change Flight Dates** dialog
that appears.

## Activating/Deactivating campaigns

You can activate or deactivate one or more campaigns directly from the
**Campaigns** screen. Check the checkbox
for each campaign that you want to activate or deactivate and click
**Actions** \> **Activate** or **Actions** \> **Deactivate**.

A confirmation dialog lists the campaign(s) to be activated or
deactivated. Click **OK** to complete the
action.

When you deactivate a campaign, the campaign will typically stop serving
within 10 - 15 seconds, with a maximum wait time of approximately 60
seconds.

## Duplicating campaigns

You can duplicate campaigns directly from the [Explore Campaigns](explore-campaigns.md).
Each new campaign will be assigned a unique ID, will not inherit the
original campaign's External Code, and will default to the Inactive
state, but will otherwise have the exact same settings as the original,
including budgets, flight dates, buying strategies, and targeting.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you duplicate a campaign that uses a buying strategy involving optimization, the optimization data (impressions, clicks, conversion, etc.) of the original campaign is not available to the new campaign. This means that the new campaign must go through its own "learning" process. For more details, see [Targeted Learn](targeted-learn.md).

1. On the **Campaigns** screen, check the
    box next to each campaign that you want to duplicate.
1. Click **Actions** \> **Duplicate**.
1. In the confirmation dialog, decide whether you want to create each
    new campaign under the original's parent line item or select a
    different line item under which all copies should be created.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > CPA campaigns use conversion pixels associated with their parent line item. Therefore, such campaigns can be copied to a different line item only if the relevant conversion pixels are also associated with that line item.

1. By default, the new campaigns have the same names as the original
    campaigns but with "Copy" as a prefix. If necessary, update the
    names for the new campaigns.
1. Review your choices and then click
    **Duplicate** to confirm the
    duplication. The new campaigns will then appear on the [Explore Campaigns](explore-campaigns.md).

## Deleting campaigns

You can delete campaigns directly from the
**Campaigns** screen. This is particularly
useful when you are approaching your object limit for campaigns, or when
you want to get rid of unnecessary or accidentally created campaigns for
a particular advertiser. For more information about object limits, see [Viewing Your Object Limits](viewing-your-object-limits.md).

> [!WARNING]
> Deleting campaigns is permanent and cannot be reverted. Also, although deleted campaigns continue to be available in reporting, you will no longer have visibility into their specific settings (e.g., budget and targeting).

1. On the **Campaigns** screen, check the
    box next to each campaign that you want to delete.
1. Click **Actions** \> **Delete**.
1. A confirmation dialog lists the campaigns that you selected for deletion. Review the list carefully and then click **Confirm** to permanently delete the campaigns from the system.

## Edit multiple campaigns with power uploader

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This offering is currently in Open Beta. It is available to all clients, but subject to change or downtime without notice.

Power Uploader enables you to edit multiple campaigns in one easy
process by updating and uploading an Excel spreadsheet, instead of [creating a new campaign](create-a-campaign.md)
 or using the [Campaign Service](../digital-platform-api/campaign-service.md).

The Beta version of Power Uploader currently supports updates to the
following fields:

## Export a spreadsheet

While this step is not required, it is recommended that you export the
Excel spreadsheet from Monetize to use as a
template and prevent errors.

1. On the **Campaigns** screen, select
    the campaigns to edit.
1. Select Edit in **Excel** \> **Export selected to
    Excel** or **Export all to
    Excel**.

    window, select the columns you want to show and/or edit in the
    spreadsheet.

    > [!NOTE]
    > ID, Name, and Status will download by default.
    
1. Click Download. The campaigns are downloaded into an editable Excel spreadsheet. The default spreadsheet name is `campaigns.xlsx`.

## Edit the spreadsheet

> [!TIP]
> While you can use your own spreadsheet containing matching column names, a spreadsheet downloaded from Monetize will include the correct column names. It is suggested to start with this downloaded spreadsheet to avoid errors.

Name and Status are required for each campaign. When you're editing
existing campaigns, treat ID as read-only so that you don't accidentally
update the wrong campaign.

To create new campaigns, leave the ID field blank.

## Import a spreadsheet

1. When you have edited and saved the spreadsheet, select
    **Edit in
    Excel** \> **Import from
    Excel**.
1. In the **Upload Spreadsheet**
    window, click **Browse**....
1. Select your edited spreadsheet. If the upload is successful, a
    confirmation message will display. If the spreadsheet is improperly
    formatted, an error message will display. Click
    **Select another file** to select a
    different spreadsheet.
1. Click **Next**. The
    **Upload Spreadsheet** window will
    display the changes for you to review before applying them.
1. Click **Apply Settings**. The changes
    will be applied.
1. If the changes are applied successfully, a confirmation message will
    display. Proceed to step 9.
1. If the changes are unsuccessful, an error message will list all the
    campaigns that could not be updated. Click on a red X for more
    details about the error for that campaign, or click
    Download Errors to download a
    spreadsheet containing all the rows that failed to update.
1. Correct the errors on the spreadsheet and return to step 1.
1. If there are no errors or you want to bypass editing errors, click
    **Go to Campaigns** to navigate back
    to the **Campaigns** screen.
