# Manage a PSP configuration

## Edit a PSP configuration

To edit a PSP configuration, do the following:

1. Within the **Publishers** menu, select **Prebid Server Premium**, which will take you to the default **Demand Partner Configurations** tab.
1. In the search box in the upper right corner, you can also filter configurations by configuration name, targeting (placement, placement group, or publisher) ID, or configuration ID.
1. You can also click the **All Statuses** menu to filter visible configurations by status to limit them to either **Enabled** or **Disabled**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This does not change the status of configurations, only which ones are visible.

1. Click on the name or row of the configuration to be edited.
1. Click the **Edit** button in the upper right of the configuration panel.
1. Optionally, edit the name, Status (Enabled/Disabled), or demand partners associated with the configuration.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Partners can be removed from configurations entirely by clicking the X icon to the right of their name.

1. If you want to add a new demand partner, click **Add Another Demand Partner**. If the partner does not appear in this list, you must first [Enable them within Global Settings](add-or-edit-a-demand-partner.md).
1. Click **Save**.

## Enable, disable, or delete configurations

If you want to enable, disable, or delete a configuration, select the corresponding checkboxes next to the configurations that you want to work with and then make your selection using the **Actions** drop-down.
