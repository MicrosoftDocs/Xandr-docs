# Data Providers - Home

Xandr facilitates the transmission of data between data providers and data buyers on the platform. Our technical team will help data providers integrate with the platform and assist purchasers in using the data they have purchased.

This documentation contains information for data providers on the processes and options for integrating data, sharing data with a buyer, and maintaining data on the platform. While Xandr does not currently operate a data marketplace, it is a platform that supports its clients' use of third-party data to enhance the performance of their campaigns. It is not our objective to sell, arbitrate, or promote any data providers to our existing clients.

Xandr serves as a facilitator and filter for our clients if and when they decide to use additional user-centric or inventory-based data to better target campaigns.
