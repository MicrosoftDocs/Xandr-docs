# Microsoft Invest - Buy-side reporting on deals

Once you've started buying deals, you can run reports to analyze how your deals are performing.

- **Member Analytics**
  The [Member Analytics Report](network-analytics-report.md) lets you view deal performance, revenue, and profit data across multiple advertisers.
- **Advertiser Analytics**
  The [Advertiser Analytics Report](advertiser-analytics-report.md) lets you view deal performance, revenue, and profit data for a specific advertiser.
- **Member Site Domain Performance**
  The [Member Site Domain Performance Report](network-site-domain-performance-report.md) lets you see the domains that deals are serving on across multiple advertisers.
- **Advertiser Site Domain Performance**
  The [Advertiser Site Domain Performance Report](site-domain-performance.md) lets you see the domains that deals are serving on for a specific advertiser.
- **Partner Center Reporting Link**
  The [Show in Reporting](partnership-details-screen-buyer-view.md) button provides a link between managing your deals in the Partner Center and checking on deal performance in the [Member Analytics Report](network-analytics-report.md).

For each of these reports, you can group by Deal to report on multiple deals at once, or you can filter by Deal to report on specific deals.
