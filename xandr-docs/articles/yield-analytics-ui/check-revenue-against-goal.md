# Check revenue against goal

Use the Revenue Against Goal widget to provide a snapshot of the order lines that are most at risk for underdelivery, organized by order, order line, or advertiser. You can then click on a specific line item to open a detailed view of its performance, as well as its consumption and competition.

1. On the Orders Dashboard page, in the Revenue Against Goal widget, click the drop-down arrow to specify whether you want to view impressions at risk **By Order**, **By Advertiser**, or **By Order Line**.
1. (Optional) Adjust the date range by clicking the Next x Day(s) filter, specifying a new standard or custom date range, and clicking **Update**.
1. View the orders or order lines at risk. You can mouse over each order or order line in the widget to view its lifetime revenue against goal, pacing, and consumption-to-schedule percentage.
1. Click a specific order line to open a detailed view at the order line's performance, as well as its consumption and competition. The Order Line Visibility page appears.
1. (Optional) On the Order Line Visibility page, click **What should I do?** to launch Scenario Manager.

To see how all orders or order lines are performing, click the **View All link** at the top of the Revenue Against Goal widget.
