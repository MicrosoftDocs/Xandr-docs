## Example

### Create the JSON report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` of `"buyer_data_usage_analytics"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and report_interval that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`month`, `day`, `hour`), and specify the `"format"` in which the data should be returned (`"csv"`, `"excel"`, or `"html"`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md).

```
$ cat buyer_data_usage_analytics

{"report":
    {
        "format": "csv",
        "report_interval": "yesterday",
        "row_per": ["geo_country"],
        "columns": ["imps","campaign_id","geo_country"],
        "report_type": "buyer_data_usage_analytics"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the [Report Service](./report-service.md)

`POST` the JSON request to get back a report ID.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X post -d @seller_brand_review "https://api.appnexus.com/report"

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"c445bca183a3d338dc1c5b85a3d484f5"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service

Make a `GET` call with the report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=c445bca183a3d338dc1c5b85a3d484f5'

{
    "response": {
        "status": "OK",
        "report": {
            "name": null,
            "created_on": "2014-11-19 22:33:31",
            "json_request": "{\"report\":{\"format\":\"csv\",\"report_interval\":\"yesterday\",\"row_per\":[\"geo_country\"],\"columns\":[\"imps\",\"campaign_id\",\"geo_country\"],\"report_type\":\"buyer_data_usage_analytics\",\"filters\":[{\"buyer_member_id\":\"958\"}]}}",
            "url": "report-download?id=c445bca183a3d338dc1c5b85a3d484f5"
        },
        "execution_status": "ready"
    }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and report ID in the `url` field of the response to your previous `GET` call. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the file format that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!NOTE]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=c445bca183a3d338dc1c5b85a3d484f5' > /tmp/buyer_data_usage_analytics.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
