# Broker service

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Broker service has been replaced by the [Partner Fee Service](partner-fee-service.md) for augmented line items (ALIs).
>
> The Broker Service can only be used with standard or legacy line items. Broker fees do not apply to augmented line items.

The Broker Service allows users of standard or legacy line items to define brokers. Brokers collect fees from networks when serving an impression. The actual fees are defined through the [Campaign Service](campaign-service.md), the [Line Item Service](line-item-service.md), or the [Insertion Order Service](insertion-order-service.md).

> [!CAUTION]
> If a broker fee is applied to an insertion order, the fee will not apply to any augmented line items associated with the insertion order. It will apply only to the insertion order's standard line items.

They can be viewed here but cannot be created or edited through this service. Refer to the Broker Fees section in each of the above-referenced services for details on how to apply fees to brokers.
