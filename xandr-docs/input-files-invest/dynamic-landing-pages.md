# Dynamic Landing Pages



As an advertiser, you may wish to send users to different landing pages
or compare the performance of different landing pages. To accomplish
this, you can associate a landing page URL with a line
item. This landing page will then be available for association
with any creatives that are attached to that line
item.

You can still attach a landing page URL at the creative level. However,
if you select the **Set a landing page at the line
item level** radio button on the
Create New screen, you will only
be able to associate the landing page URL at that level. If the **Set a
landing page at the line item level** radio
button is selected and there is no landing page URL at the
line item level, the creative will not serve.



<b>Note:</b> All landing page URLs must have
`https://` included in the URL string. For example,
`https://www.``appnexus``.com` is a valid
landing page URL. Excluding `https://` from the URL string may result in
errors.
