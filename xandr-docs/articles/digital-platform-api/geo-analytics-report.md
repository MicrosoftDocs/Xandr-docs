# Geo analytics report

The **Geo Analytics** report allows you to break down campaign delivery and performance by geographic area. Sample use cases for this report include:

- Buyers who would like to optimize their campaigns
- Buyers who need to report to their client advertisers or agencies on campaign delivery

This report can break down campaign performance along the following geographic boundaries:

- **Country**: The user's [country](./country-service.md) location.
- **Region**: The user's [regional](./region-service.md) location.
- **DMA**: The user's [designated market area](./designated-market-area-service.md).

For more information on the available data fields and their definitions, see [Dimensions](#dimensions) and [Metrics](#metrics) below.

For instructions on running this report, see the [Example](#example).

> [!NOTE]
> **On the accuracy of determining user geography by IP address**
>
> There is a limitation to how accurate the geo data is, particularly on impressions bought from external supply partners. Since some external supply partners (such as Google Ad Manager) truncate the last octet of the user's IP, we have a less precise IP to use when performing an IP geo-lookup. As a result, our geo data may not always be completely accurate at granular levels (such as region and DMA) for impressions bought from these supply sources.

## Time frame

The `report_interval` field in the request can be set to one of the following:

- today
- yesterday
- last_7_days

**Data retention period**

Data retention period for this report is 45 days.

> [!NOTE]
> To run a report for a custom time frame, set the `start_date` and `end_date` fields in your report request. For more details about these fields, see [Report Service](./report-service.md).

| `member_id` | int | Yes | The ID of the member. |
| `advertiser_currency` | string | Yes | The type of currency used by the advertiser. |
| `insertion_order_id` | int | Yes | The insertion order ID. |
| `campaign_id` | int | Yes | The campaign ID. |
| `campaign_name` | string | No | The name of the campaign associated with the auction. |
| `campaign` | string | No | **Deprecated**. |

| `advertiser_name` | string | No | The name of the advertiser. |
| `advertiser` | string | No | **Deprecated**. |
| `split_id` | int | Yes | The ID of the split that purchased the impressions in this data set. Splits are only applicable to augmented line items. For any reports that contain campaigns, the `split_id` (if included) will be `null`. |
| `split_name` | string | Yes | The name of the split that purchased the impressions in this data set. Splits are only applicable to augmented line items. For any reports that contain campaigns, the `split_name` (if included) will be `null`. |
| `campaign_code` | string | No | The user-assigned code used to identify the campaign. |
| `advertiser_code` | string | No | The user-assigned code associated with the advertiser. |
| `geo_country_code` | string | Yes | The country code of the user's location as defined by the [Country Service](./country-service.md). |
| `geo_country_id` | int | Yes | The country ID of the user's location as defined by the [Country Service](./country-service.md). `250` is shown in cases where we don't know the country or if the country doesn't map correctly to a location in our database. |
| `geo_region_code` | string | No | The region code of the user's location as defined by the [Region Service](./region-service.md). |
| `geo_region_id` | int | Yes | The region ID of the user's location as defined by the [Region Service](./region-service.md). `4291` is shown in cases where we don't know the region or if the region doesn't map correctly to a location in our database. |
| `geo_dma_id` | int | Yes | The ID of the user's designated market area location as defined by the [Designated Market Area Service](./designated-market-area-service.md).<br><br>**Note**: **Why am I seeing a DMA ID of `1`**?<br>Our reporting derives DMA from the city logged for the auction. However, our geo provider is sometimes unable to determine a city from the IP address associated with the impression, even when DMA **is** determined. Therefore, there are cases where a campaign targeting a specific DMA has impressions in reporting showing a DMA of `1`. |
| `geo_dma_name` | string | No | The name of the user's designated market area location as defined by the [Designated Market Area Service](./designated-market-area-service.md). |
| `geo_postal_code` | string | Yes | The postal code of the user's location. For postal codes, see [Postal Code Service](./postal-code-service.md). |
| `geo_city_id` | int | Yes | The ID of the user's city location. For city IDs, see [City Service](./city-service.md). |

| `geo_country` | string | No | **Deprecated**. |
| `geo_region` | string | No | **Deprecated**. |
| `geo_dma` | string | No | **Deprecated**. |
| `pixel_id` | int | Yes | The unique identification number of the conversion pixel.<br><br>**Note**: This dimension will return a maximum of 10 conversion pixels. Also, you can filter by no more than 10 conversion pixels. Although `pixel_id` is groupable, we do not recommend that you group by this dimension since doing so will cause conversion events to then be shown in separate rows from impression and click events. We generally assume you want to view all of these events in a single row so as to be able to retrieve accurate and aggregated values for conversion rate and cost-per-conversion calculations. As a result, we instead recommend that you filter by `pixel_id` so you can retrieve conversion counts and related metrics for your most relevant pixel IDs. |
| `buying_currency` | string | Yes | The transaction currency used by the buyer to purchase this impression. |
| `uk_constituent_country` | string | No | The constituent country of the user. This is applicable for United Kingdom. Possible values include:<br> - `England`<br> - `Scotland`<br> - `Wales`<br> - `Northern Ireland` |

## Example

### Create the JSON-formatted report request

The file should contain the `report_type` of `"geo_analytics"` as well as the columns and report_interval that you want to retrieve. For a full explanation of the fields that can be included in the file, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md).

Note that the more dimensions you group by, the larger the data set being returned will be. Larger data sets may take substantially longer to process, so be sure to group by only those dimensions you require.

```
$ cat geo_analytics
