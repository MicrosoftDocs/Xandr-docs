# Exchange service

Exchanges are groups of sellers organized to allow for easier supply targeting.

- This inventory will be targeted all at once. You can combine it with domain list targeting and member targeting.
- As new sellers are added, you do not have to update your profile or targeting. When targeting a single exchange, you will receive all members within it and any new members that join.
- We took our premium publishers and put them all in one group, called "Supply". When you access and target inventory, you can target Supply. This will target all those premium publishers for you.
  - You can find out more information about Supply here: [Supply for External Demand Partners](xandr-monetize-supply-for-external-demand-partners.md)
- Sellers that belong to Exchange 1, Supply, cannot be individually included and excluded. The group must be targeted as a whole. You can individually include/exclude members that belong to other exchanges.

Today we have three exchanges:

| ID | Name | Description |
|--|--|--|
| 1 | Direct | These are premium publishers on our platform that we have direct integrations with. This inventory is brought to you directly through Xandr's SSP technology, and is formed at its core from our direct-to-publisher supply most frequently requested and purchased by our buyers across all formats (display, mobile, video, and native). |
| 2 | Connect | These are the SSPs such as Pubmatic, Google Ad Manager, etc. |
| 3 | Network | All ad-networks that represent many publishers and act as SSPs. |
