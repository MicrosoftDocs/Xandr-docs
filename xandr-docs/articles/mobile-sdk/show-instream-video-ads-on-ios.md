# Show instream video ads on iOS

This page describes how to use the SDK to fetch and display instream
video ads.

## Prerequisite 

Include the SDK in your project. As of
the [version 3.0 release](https://github.com/appnexus/mobile-sdk-ios/releases/tag/3.0), the SDK has instream video support. For instructions on how to integrate the SDK, see [Integrate the SDK](ios-sdk-integration-instructions.md).

## Steps to show instream ads

### Step 1: Initialize the video ad Object

A video ad can be fetched and displayed with as few as three
methods `initWithPlacementId:`, `loadAdWithDelegate:` and `playAdWithContainer:withDelegate:`.
Defining the delegates for loading and playback will provide granular
feedback for the video ad lifecycle.

In this step, initialize `ANInstreamVideoAd` with the placement ID.

``` 
ANInstreamVideoAd  *videoAd  = [[ANInstreamVideoAd alloc] initWithPlacementId:@"MY-PLACEMENT-ID"];
```

### Step 2: Load the video ad

Load the video ad and (optionally) define
the `ANInstreamVideoAdLoadDelegate`.

Using the `ANInstreamVideoAdLoadDelegate` is highly recommended. It
indicates when the load is complete or, alternatively, whether an error
occurred during load.

The delegates return the instance of `ANInstreamVideoAd`, expressed as a
reference to its superclass `ANAdProtocol`. It is shared with other
Mobile SDK ad formats. The video ad object retains state that may be
useful to refer during the lifecycle of the video ad.

Video ad state includes the placement ID, whether the video ad was
clicked or skipped, and error feedback in the case of failure. (For
complete details, see *`ANInstreamVideoAd.h`* .)

``` 
@interface  ViewController()  <ANInstreamVideoAdLoadDelegate, ANInstreamVideoAdPlayDelegate>
    //...
@end
@protocol  ANInstreamVideoAdLoadDelegate <NSObject>
    @required
    - (void) adDidReceiveAd:(id<ANAdProtocol>)ad;
    @optional
    - (void) ad:(id<ANAdProtocol>)ad requestFailedWithError:(NSError *)error;
@end
[videoAd loadAdWithDelegate:self];
```

## Step 3: Show the video ad

Display the video ad over your content
container `UIView` and define the `ANInstreamVideoAdPlayDelegate`.

The delegate methods return the instance of `ANInstreamVideoAd`,
expressed as a reference to its superclass `ANAdProtocol`. It is
shared with other Mobile SDK ad formats. In addition to returning video
ad state, the required method `adDidComplete:withState:` indicates when
the video ad has completed.

``` 
@protocol  ANInstreamVideoAdPlayDelegate <NSObject>
    @required
    - (void) adDidComplete:  (id<ANAdProtocol>)ad
                 withState:  (ANInstreamVideoPlaybackStateType)state;
    @optional
    - (void) adCompletedFirstQuartile:  (id<ANAdProtocol>)ad;
    - (void) adCompletedMidQuartile:    (id<ANAdProtocol>)ad;
    - (void) adCompletedThirdQuartile:  (id<ANAdProtocol>)ad;
        - (void) adPlayStarted: (id<ANAdProtocol>)ad;
         //...
@end
[videoAd playAdWithContainer:MY-VIDEO-CONTENT-UIVIEW withDelegate:self];
```

`ANInstreamVideoAdPlayDelegate` contains many useful optional methods
that further define video ad playback state and lifecycle for both the
video ad and the landing page. (See *`ANInstreamVideoAd.h`* for complete
details.)

## Pause and resume the video ad

To pause or resume playing the video ad use the following method calls: 

``` 
(void) pauseAd;
 
 (void) resumeAd; 
```

## Choose which browser opens the landing page

When the video ad is clicked, video ad playback is paused and the click
tracker is fired. Then, the click-through URL is opened in the in-app
browser OR in the native browser according to the setting of
the `opensInNativeBrower` property:

- *In-app Browser*: Click-through content loads within the app in a
  pop-up `UIView`.
- *Native Browser*: The app is suspended so the click-through content
  may load in the native browser.

The following properties are exposed by `ANInstreamVideoAd` to manage
the target browser and whether the landing page loads before or after
the landing page is displayed.

``` 
videoAd.opensInNativeBrowser = NO;           // DEFAULT is NO.
videoAd.landingPageLoadsInBackground = YES;  // DEFAULT is YES.
```

When the user returns from the browser, the video ad will resume
playback.

## Load more than one video ad per session

Any number of video ads may be loaded in a single session. Accomplish
this by calling `initWithPlacementId:` and `loadAdWtihDelegate:` once
for each video ad object.

## Fetch the attributes of a loaded video creative

Once the video is loaded, you may retrieve various attributes of the
creative:

``` 
-(NSUInteger) getAdDuration; //Provide the duration of the loaded video
-(NSString *) getCreativeURL; //Provide the creative that will be played
-(NSString *) getVastURL; //Provide the vastURL that is loaded
-(NSString *) getVastXML: //Provide the vastXML that is loaded
-(ANVideoOrientation) getVideoOrientation; //Provide the Orientation of the Video rendered. Possible video orientations can be square, portrait, landscape or none
```

## Determine ad play progress

You can determine how far the adPlay has progressed.

``` 
-(NSUInteger) getAdPlayElapsedTime;
```

## Video ad fullscreen display

Mobile SDK provides no functionality
for displaying video ads or developer designated content in full screen
mode. The video ad container automatically appears over the frame of the
content container view using the same dimensions and positioning of the
content container view. (See above `playWithAdContainer:withDelegate:`.)

This means you have control over whether the video ad displays in full
screen mode by managing the frame of the content container view. By
extension, if you want to give control over full screen mode to the
user, you must provide appropriate interface options to the user.

> [!NOTE]
> Video Playback Controls
>
> In iOS, it is idiomatic to use the transport controls provided by `AVPlayerViewController` with property `showsPlaybackControls`. This method is incompatible with Xandr's Mobile SDK because, in this case, the full screen option creates a modal view which displays over all current views, obscuring the video ad container which displays over the content container. Full screen functionality for the video ad must be handled some means other than creating a modal view.
