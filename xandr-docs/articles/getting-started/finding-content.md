# Tips on Finding What You Need 

We hope you're enjoying the Xandr Documentation Center. We want it to be a great experience for you. If you can't find what you're looking for, here are some possible reasons why, and what to do.

## I Can't Find Some of the Monetize SSP, Invest DSP, or Curate Topics 

We've made most of the documentation related to our Digital Platform products publicly available, but there are still a few topics that contain proprietary information that we can't share unless you're a customer. In order to see this content you'll need to log in to the product to access these select few topics.

## I'm Not Finding What I'm Looking for When I Search 

There are a few reasons this could be happening.

1.  **Filters are too granular**

    You can select a filter from the search bar when you initially conduct your search. When the search results are displayed, you're presented with more filters on the left side of the screen to further refine your results. If you're not seeing what you expect in the results, try the following:

    -   Remove some or all of the filters from the options on the left to reveal more results.
    -   Remove the filters from the search bar **Filter** menu and try your search again.
    -   Try another search phrase or term.
    **Note:** If you enter a new search term in the search bar, your **Filters** in the search bar are still there. Don't forget to clear them or change them if your new search should be using different filters.

2.  **Documents are not labeled correctly**

    We did our best to label everything when we moved it to the new system, but we may have mislabeled some of the pages. As a resault, documents that you would expect to be returned in a filtered search aren't. If this is the case, clear your filters as described in Step 1. When you find the mislabeled \(or unlabeled\) content, use the **Feedback** button \(the speech bubble\) under the page title and let us know what you filtered on and what you expected to find.

3.  **We haven't moved the documents to the Documentation Center yet**

    The Documentation Center currently includes only *publicly available documentation*. Documentation previously accessed by logging in to [wiki.xandr.com](https://wiki.xandr.com) is still only avaialble there. This includes:

    -   GDPR
    -   Data Providers
    -   Alpha/Beta products
    -   Finance
    -   Yield Analytics
    -   Company-specific documents
    -   Any other password-protected content
    This is only temporary until we get a new single sign-on password system in place. After that, you'll be able to log in to see all your content here in the Documentation Center.


## What Documentation Should I Be Finding? 

Currently, you'll find the following sets of documents \(excluding any password-protected content\):

-   Monetize SSP
-   Invest DSP
-   Monetize TV DDL
-   Monetize TV Addressable
-   Monetize TV PMP
-   Invest TV DDL
-   Invest TV Addressable
-   Industry Reference
-   Digital Platform API
-   Bidders
-   Supply Partners
-   Log Level Data Feeds
-   Mobiles SDK
-   Seller Tag \(AST\)
-   Service Policies
-   OTT and CTV Video Integrations
-   Advanced Ads Toolset
-   Yield Analytics API

## How Do I Find All the Content with a Particular Tag? 

Each page has been tagged with properties relating to the product, workflow, and so on that the topic applies to. The tags that have been applied to each page are displayed at the top of the page. To search for all content with a particular tag, or set of tags, follow these steps:

1.  Click the **Filter** dropdown next to the Search box. You'll see a list of filters, each of which corresponds to a tag with the same name.
2.  Select all filters you want to apply.
3.  To find all pages with these tags, leave the search box empty.
4.  Click the search icon \(or press Enter\).

From the search results page you can continue to narrow down your result set by clicking options in the **Refine Results** list on the left.

See "I'm Not Finding What I'm Looking for When I Search" above for more information on search results.

## Where are Support and Training? 

We've provided links to them under the [Additional Resources](/category/more-info) tile. As this Documentation Center grows, we'll be adding more resources. Be sure to keep coming back to see what we've added!

## Why Can't I Log In? 

There's no need to! All the content in the Documentation Center is publicly available. The Login option is only for site administrators.

We do plan to add more content in the future, some of which *will* require you to log in, but we'll be sure to let you know when that happens.

**Note:** Xandr employees can use their SSO credentials to log in to the Documentation Center and see a limited set of additional documentation.

## How Do I Provide Feedback? 

Click the **Feedback** button \(the speech bubble\) at the top of this or any content page. We'd love to hear from you!
