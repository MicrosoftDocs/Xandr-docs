# Working With user groups

Permissions within yield analytics are configured through user groups.
Each yield analytics user account can belong to multiple groups.
However, the group with the broadest permissions overrides the more
restrictive groups (Example: If a user belongs to the Admin group and
the AdOps group, the permissions for the Admin group win).

If you have administrative permissions, you can add, edit, duplicate,
and delete user groups.
