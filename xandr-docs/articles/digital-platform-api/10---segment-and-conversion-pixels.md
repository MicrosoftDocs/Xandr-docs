# Segment and conversion pixels

Pixels can be used for two main purposes in Xandr: segment targeting and conversion tracking.

## Segment pixels

Segment pixels can be targeted via the profile service to restrict a campaign/line item/creative to targeting a specific subset of users. If no advertiser ID is specified, the segment is created at the network level and is available to all advertisers within the network. The
example below shows how to create a new segment under a specific advertiser.

### How to create a new segment under a specific advertiser?

Make a file containing JSON and add the correct values. Necessary fields include short name, advertiser ID and expire minutes.

```
$cat segment
{
  "segment": {
    "short_name": "Retargeting Segment",
    "advertiser_id": 1234,
    "expire_minutes": 20160
  }
  }
```

## Conversion pixels

Conversion pixels can be used to attribute conversions to specific auctions (and with line items and creatives) as well as for optimization when optimizing to a specific CPA. All conversion pixels must be associated with specific advertisers and with specific line items. The example below shows how to create a new conversion pixel and associate it with a line item for attribution tracking.

### How to create a new conversion pixel?

Make a file containing JSON and add the correct values. Necessary fields include advertiser id, trigger type and name.

```
$cat pixel
{
  "pixel": {
    "name": "Conversion Pixel",
    "advertiser_id": 1234,
    "trigger_type": "hybrid"
  }
}
```

After creating the pixel using a POST request to the API, you can associate the pixel with a line item with a PUT request to the line item
service. The sample JSON below shows the format of the call to modify the line item and associate pixel 12345.

```
$cat line_item
{
  "line_item": {
    "id": 205,
    "pixels":[
      {
        "id": 12345,
        "state": "active",
        "post_click_revenue": 100,
        "post_view_revenue": 50
      }
    ],
    ...
  }
}
```
