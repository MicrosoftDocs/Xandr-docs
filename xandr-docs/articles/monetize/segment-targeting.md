# Segment Targeting

<div id="ID-00004ec9__body-48191887-4c3a-4488-9d4b-c73264963981"
class="body">

You can target users within segments by using Boolean expressions. Users
get added to segments after they've viewed or clicked a particular
creative.

You can set up segment targeting by going to the
Audience &
Location Targeting \> Audience &
Location Segments subsection within the
Create New Line Item screen or
Edit Line Item screen. The
Audience & Location Segments
subsection displays all segments belonging to the advertiser for the
associated line item as well as segments defined at the
Network level.
