# Working with creatives

You can traffic a wide range of creative types, from banners to increasingly pervasive rich media types, through the Xandr platform. Only secure content is supported.

## Hosted creatives

The Xandr platform functions as a full-service ad server built specifically for the real-time advertising business.
Hosting your creatives with us lets you take full advantage of this technology. In addition, you gain a single source for advanced reporting data, avoid paying ad serving fees to multiple parties, and can rely on Xandr creative standards and auditing processes to ensure high ad quality and consistency.

## Third-party creatives

Xandr also makes it easy for you to traffic creatives that are served by third-party ad servers.
