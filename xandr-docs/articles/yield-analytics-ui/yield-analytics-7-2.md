# Yield Analytics 7.2

Please note that we have extended the amount of time that the old Reporting Screen would be available. We added an additional release cycle, making the new date October 7th.

- New Reporting Screen Changes

We continue to work on enhancing the reporting screen. Here are the highlights for this release:

- On the left hand configuration panel, we have changed the logic to display on metric or dimension filters that are applied to the report that you are viewing. The left hand panel is defaulted to a summary view of what is selected.
- Increase the “product select” box from 250 to 2,000.
- Adjusted the logic for select all - to select all available data, instead of all visible data.
