# Onboarding Your Audience Data



There are three ways to onboard your audience data:

- <a href="client-side-segmentation.md" class="xref">Client-Side
  Segmentation</a>: Allows you to build audience segments by placing
  client-side segment pixels on websites or creatives for simple
  audience targeting strategies.
- <a
  href="xandr-api/batch-server-side-segmentation.md"
  class="xref" target="_blank">Batch Server-Side Segmentation</a>:
  Allows you to batch your users together and add them to segments in
  bulk, via the API.
- <a
  href="xandr-api/streaming-server-side-segmentation.md"
  class="xref" target="_blank">Streaming Server-Side Segmentation</a>:
  This method associates individual users to segments in close to
  real-time, via the API. (<b>Note:</b> At the moment, this feature is only
  available to a small group of Alpha testers. It will be released more
  widely over the course of the next several months.)
