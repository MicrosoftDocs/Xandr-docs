## WHAT IS INCREMENTALITY

Advertisers want to ensure the effectiveness of their advertising
campaigns and that they are getting the best return on their advertising
spend. The Return on Advertising Spend model (ROAS), with its simplified
Revenue/Cost equation, provides a generalized view of the success of a
campaign. However, the ROAS model misses the complexity of modern
advertising and quantifies every user and inventory platform equally.
Attribution models such as Last-touch and Multi-touch can provide a more
detailed means to measure the impact of a campaign, but they do not
prove causality and fail to answer the question: 

*"Is my campaign driving people to spend money on my product, or would
they have converted anyway?”*

To answer this question advertisers need to measure incrementality.

Incrementality is the measurement of incremental lift, the percentage of
conversions that can be attributed to an advertisement or advertising
campaign. Measuring incrementality moves performance measurement towards
answering the question of causality.





## Incrementality and Xandr

Xandr provides a
<a href="log-level-incrementality-feed.md" class="xref">Log-Level
Incrementality Feed</a> which provides data on impressions shown to an
audience randomly split between a test group (the group exposed to ads)
and a control group (the group not exposed to ads). Additionally, we
have provided a
<a href="incrementality-and-xandr.md" class="xref">best practices
document</a> to help our customers plan their incrementality strategies
and testing.
