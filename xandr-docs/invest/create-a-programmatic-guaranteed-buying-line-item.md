# Create a programmatic guaranteed buying line item in Microsoft Invest

A programmatic guaranteed buying line item (PG line item) provides you
with a workflow specifically designed for buying a programmatic
guaranteed deal (PG deal).

A PG line item can only target one PG deal. PG line items have very
different targeting, budgeting, and optimization options compared to
augmented line items. See [Programmatic
Guaranteed Buying Line Items](programmatic-guaranteed-buying-line-items.md) for more information before creating one.

## Before you begin

Before you create a PG line item, you must perform the following tasks:

- [Create an Advertiser](create-an-advertiser.md)
- [Create an Insertion Order](create-an-insertion-order.md)

  The insertion order you created must have at least one Billing Period with dates in the future.

You must also have access to one or more PG deals to target. Sellers
must first create these deals for buyers to access them for targeting.
If you have questions about how to gain access to a PG deal, please
contact your account manager.

The following tasks are recommended but not required:

- [Create a Conversion Pixel](create-a-conversion-pixel.md)
- [Add Creatives in Bulk](add-creatives-in-bulk.md)

## Start a new PG line item

To create a new PG line item, do the following:

1. Click **Create New** in the **Line Item** menu or section. If prompted, **select an advertiser** in the Select an Advertiser screen. The **Create New Line Item screen** opens.
1. On the **Create New Line Item** screen, select **Programmatic Guaranteed** under **Line Item Type**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > You must have an **advertiser** and **insertion order** associated with the line item in the Advertiser and Insertion Order sections. If necessary, select an advertiser and insertion order.

1. Click **Next** to open the **Create a Programmatic Guaranteed Line Item** screen.

## Basic setup

In the **Basic Setup** section, enter the
following details for the PG line item:

- **Programmatic Guaranteed Deal** - the Programmatic Guaranteed deal
  associated to the PG line item. Enter the name of the PG deal and
  select it. The details of the PG deal display and include the
  following:
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The PG deal details shown are configured by the seller of the deal and cannot be changed by settings in the PG line item.

   - **Seller** - name of the seller of the
    deal
   - **Start Date** - date the deal becomes
    active
   - **End Date** - date after which the
    deal is no longer active
  - **Projected Media Cost** - total
    projected media cost derived from the projected number and price of
    impressions reserved for this PG deal
    - **Impressions** - number of
      impressions reserved for this PG deal
    - **Price** - price of impressions for
      this PG deal
  - **Geo Targeting** - location of geo
    targeting used by this PG deal
- **Insertion Order** - the insertion order associated to this PG line item. If you create the line item from the **Insertion Order Details** screen, the insertion order is automatically associated. Otherwise, click **Edit** to associate the line item to an insertion order.
  
> [!NOTE]
> PG line items **override** insertion order budgets, all levels of targeting, and any established frequency caps to ensure you fulfill your agreement with the publisher. PG line items **do not override** insertion order flight dates. You can keep a PG line item from spending by setting it to "Inactive" at any time.

- **Line Item Name** - enter the name for
  the PG line item. You will later be able to search for and report on this PG line item using this name.
- **External Code**: - if you want to report on this PG line item using an external code, enter the code here. The code may only contain alphanumeric characters, periods,underscores, or dashes. The code you enter is not case-sensitive (i.e., uppercase and lowercase characters are treated the same). PG line items associated to the same advertiser cannot use the same external code.
- **State** - set the state of the line
  item. If **"Active"**, the line item
  will be eligible to serve.
- **Revenue Type - Cost Plus** is the required revenue
  type for PG line items. With **Cost Plus**, the advertiser will pay for your media cost (whatever you spend on buying inventory) plus an extra amount (a margin) that you charge the advertiser in addition to the media cost. You can set this margin as a percentage of cost (**% margin**) or as a fixed CPM fee (**CPM margin**). You must enter a percentage for **% margin** or a fee for **CPM margin** greater than or equal to
  zero.

## Optimization

You can use conversion tracking on PG line items, see [Create a Conversion Pixel](create-a-conversion-pixel.md).

## Conversion tracking

Click the edit icon to associate conversion
tracking pixels to this PG line item. Note that these pixels are not used by optimization, but can be used to track the line item's performance.
