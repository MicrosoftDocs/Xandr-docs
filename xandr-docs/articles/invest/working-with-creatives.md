# Working with Creatives



You can traffic a wide range of creative types, from banners to
increasingly pervasive rich media types, through the
Xandr platform. Only secure content is
supported.



## Hosted Creatives

The Xandr platform functions as a full-service
ad server built specifically for the real-time advertising business.
Hosting your creatives with us lets you take full advantage of this
technology. In addition, you gain a single source for advanced reporting
data, avoid paying ad serving fees to multiple parties, and can rely on
Xandr creative standards and auditing processes
to ensure high ad quality and consistency.




## Third-Party Creatives

Xandr also makes it easy for you to traffic
creatives that are served by third-party ad servers.
