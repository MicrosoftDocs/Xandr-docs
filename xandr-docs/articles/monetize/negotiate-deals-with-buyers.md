# Negotiate Deals with Buyers



Xandr sellers can negotiate custom deals to
offer buyers a variety of special rate and inventory access options.
These include:

- Special access to premium inventory
- Inventory in bulk for discounted rates
- Other opportunities

This page explains how to negotiate and set up deals with both
Monetize buyers as well as buyers using external
bidders.

Deals with Monetize Buyers

You can negotiate deals with buyers on the Xandr
platform from the Partner Center.

For more information on communicating with buyers and viewing deals, see
the <a href="partnership-details-screen-seller-view.html"
class="xref">Partnership Details Screen - Seller View</a>.

Once you've negotiated deal terms with a buyer, you can create the deal
in the Partner Center. For step-by-step instructions, see
<a href="create-a-custom-deal.html" class="xref">Create a Custom
Deal</a>.

Deals with External Buyers (Bidders)

Step 1. Negotiate a deal

Negotiate a deal with the buyer offline. Then ask the buyer for their
Xandr member ID so you can set up the deal in
Monetize.



Note: **If you have not seen delivery
from this bidder previously**, be sure to ask the buyer to make sure
that the bidder has you (the seller) in an allowlist in their bidder
profile. This is an important step: if the bidder does not receive
traffic from you, the buyer will not be able to buy through the
negotiated deal.



Step 2. Create a deal in Monetize

Select the buyer on the
<a href="partner-center-screen-seller-view.html" class="xref">Partner
Center Screen - Seller View</a>, and then follow the step-by-step
instructions on the
<a href="create-a-custom-deal.html" class="xref">Create a Custom
Deal</a> page. Once the deal has been set up in
Monetize, contact the buyer and give them the
deal ID.

Step 3. Buyers enter the deal into the bidder's UI

The buyer enters the deal ID into their bidder's system to have the
bidder target the deal.



Important: When working with buyers
using Doubleclick Bid Manager, you can direct them to Doubleclick's
documentation

for information on entering a deal ID into Bid Manager.
