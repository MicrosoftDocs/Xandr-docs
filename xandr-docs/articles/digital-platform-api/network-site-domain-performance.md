# Network site domain performance

The **Network Site Domain Performance** report can be used to view performance and optimization data by domain for all of a network's advertisers.

> [!NOTE]
> To view performance and optimization data by domain for a specific advertiser, filter this report by `advertiser_id`, or use the [Site Domain Performance Report](./site-domain-performance-report.md) report.
>
> For instructions on retrieving a report, please see [Report Service](./report-service.md) or the [example](#example) below.

## Time frame

The `report_interval` field can be set to one of the following:

- yesterday
- last_7_days
- month_to_yesterday
- month_to_date

If you use the `start_date` and `end_date` fields to define the time range, the `start_date` must not be more than 30 days in the past. Since hourly data is not available for this report, the `start_date` and `end_date` cannot be identical and must be formatted as `"YYYY-MM-DD"` rather than `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"`.

**Data retention period**

Data retention period for this report is 45 days.

We generally assume you want to view all of these events in a single row so as to be able to retrieve accurate and aggregated values for conversion rate and cost-per-conversion calculations. As a result, we instead recommend that you filter by `pixel_id` so you can retrieve conversion counts and related metrics for your most relevant pixel IDs. |
