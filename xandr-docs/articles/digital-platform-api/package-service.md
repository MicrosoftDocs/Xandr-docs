# Package service

Sellers use this service to create and manage their packages. Packages are pre-made combinations of inventory and/or data. Buyers can use the [Package Buyer Access Service](package-buyer-access-service.md) to browse packages and then use the [Deal From Package Service](./deal-from-package-service.md) to create deals from them "off-the-shelf", or they can use packages as a jumping-off point for deal negotiations.

In cases where packages don't meet a buyer's needs, sellers can use the [Deal Service](./deal-service.md) to create one-off custom deals.

## JSON fields

| Name | Type (Length) | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `id` | int | The ID of the package.<br><br>**Default**: Auto-generated number<br>**Required On**: `PUT`, `DELETE` |
| `name` | string (255) | The name of the package. |
| `description` | string (65535) | The description of the package. You can use this field to provide buyers additional insight and details about the package. |
| `active` | Boolean | If `true`, the package is active. If `false`, buyers cannot generate deals from the package and all associated deals will stop serving.<br><br>**Default**: `true` |
| `profile_id` | int | The ID of the profile associated to the package. You can use a profile to specify publishers, placements, sites, content categories, segments, segment groups, or sizes that need to be involved in the auction in order for the deal to be available to the buyer. For more details, see `publisher_targets`, `placement_targets`, `content_category_targets`, `segment_targets`, `segment_group_targets`, `site_targets` , and `size_targets` in the [Profile Service](./profile-service.md).<br><br>**CAUTION**: Any other targeting settings in the associated profile will not be respected.<br><br>**Required On**: `POST` |
| `default_ask_price` | double | The ask price that will be applied to all deals generated from the package. When a buyer generates a deal, the [Deal Service](./deal-service.md) will automatically calculate the `floor_price` by subtracting the seller revenue share specified in your contract from the value in this field. This is the price shown to the buyer. It is the minimum they must bid in order to compete for the inventory.<br><br>**Note**: You must use the `member_ask_price` field to set pricing when `visibility_type` is set to `2`. When `visibility_type` is set to `1`, you can use the `member_ask_price` field to set different pricing for select buyers.<br><br>**Required On**: `POST` |
| `default_currency` | enum | The ask price currency that will be applied to all deals generated from the package. For a full list of available currencies, use the read-only [Currency Service](./currency-service.md).<br><br>**Default**: `"USD"` |

The deal's floor price will override any other floors you may have, i.e., in placements or yield management profiles.<br><br>**Note**: If `default_use_deal_floor` is `false`, `default_ask_price` must be set to `0`. In this case, note that although the ask price is shown as `0`, no deal floor is actually applied; if you have any other floors (in placements or yield management profiles), they will be applied, or if you do not have any other floors, the standard second-price auction mechanics will apply.<br><br>**Default**: `true` |
| `last_modified` | timestamp | The day and time when the package was last modified. |
| `data_protected` | Boolean | **Not yet supported**.<br>**Default**: `false` |

If `visibility_type` is set to `"private"`, only the buyers listed in this array can view the package. If `visibility_type` is set to `"console"`, all buyers can view the package but you can define a different ask price for each of the buyers listed in this array. Each `member` object in this array contains the following fields.

| `member_ask_price` | int | The ask price that will be applied to deals the buyer generates from the package. When the buyer generates a deal, the [Deal From Package Service](./deal-from-[ackage-service.md]) will automatically calculate the `floor_price` by subtracting the seller revenue share specified in your contract from the value in this field. This is the price shown to the buyer. It is the minimum they must bid in order to compete for the inventory.<br><br>**Note**: If `member_use_deal_floor` is `false`, this field must be set to `0`. In this case, note that although `0` is shown as the floor price, no deal floor is actually applied; if you have any other floors (in placements or yield management profiles), they will be applied, or if you do not have any other floors, the standard second-price auction mechanics will apply. |
