# Microsoft Curate - Planner analytics

The article outlines the functionality of Planner visualizations, emphasizing their role in presenting a summary and visual representation of anticipated deal line-item performance within a selected plan from the list. It highlights that more detailed and interactive projections can be explored by users during the creation or editing of a plan.

Planner's visualizations can guide your media plan and help you understand the capability of specific deals. As you try out different configurations in the left pane while you create or edit a plan, you can update the analytics and visualizations to show the projected results, so you can adjust your strategy before making a final decision.

> [!NOTE]
> Planner relies on data that is collected over time for its forecasts. For the most accurate results, audiences should be onboarded and deals should be live for a week before you begin forecasting in Planner.

A user is a device ID, not an actual person: often a person has multiple user IDs. If you've enabled cross-device, Planner returns estimates for all the device IDs linked to a user. For impression estimates, we sample auction logs and generate sketches that include dimensions (supply type, ad type, inventory URL, and so on) specific to the auction. For user estimates, we sample users and include geo region, segments, and other data. We also find all associated auctions and related dimensions, and use all this data to generate sketches.

## Summary view

When you select a completed plan from the list in the main **Planning** screen, you can see non-interactive overview information about targeting and supply in the right pane.
