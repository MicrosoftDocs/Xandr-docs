# Lazy Load for Android

The Lazy Load feature provides a new API call to manage when all trackers are fired, including third-party trackers and Mobile SDK trackers. It also optimizes the Banner AdUnit by allowing the host app to load its webview only when it is needed and just before it is needed. When this feature is enabled, the traditional **loadAd** method is followed later by a second method, **loadLazyAd**.  

## Firing trackers

The Lazy Load feature is developed to fire all Mobile SDK and third-party trackers at the same instance, ensuring an alignment between both the metrics can be maintained.

The high-level lifecycle of an AdUnit consists of two stages as **load** and **display**. This feature divides the **load** stage into two further steps as **loadAd** and **loadLazyAd**, followed by **display** stage. Having said that, a banner webview can be attached to the **display**, even before **loadAd** is called. However, the **display** stage is a convenience provided by the platform and is separate from the **load** portion of the AdUnit lifecycle.  

The second step **loadLazyAd** in load stage accomplishes two tasks:

- Completes the load of the AdUnit by creating and loading the webview which fires the third-party trackers in the creative.
- Fires the Mobile SDK trackers.  

## Managing CPU consumption

The Lazy Load feature causes the initial loadAd to return a lightweight AdUnit and allows the contents to be loaded later. This functionality reduces the load time for the AdUnit by deferring the creation and configuration of the internal webview to a later point. By delaying the webview load, it reduces the consumption of additional CPU time of loading the ad object returned in the Universal Tag in the cases where the AdUnit is unused.

Additionally, it allows the host app to choose the optimal moment to fire trackers and consume CPU time to load the webview, ideally at the best possible moment before the ad is displayed to the end-user (or is queued for display with a high probability).

## Scope of Lazy Load

The scope of this feature is limited to Banner AdUnits that display banner and native assembly renderer Media Types. It does not apply to any other AdUnit, including instream video and native, nor does it apply to Media Types returned by a multi-format Banner AdUnit other than banner and native assembly renderer including banner-video (outstream video) and banner-native.

## Properties

Lazy Load enhances the Mobile SDK public API with a property (a getter method) which indicates whether the feature is enabled or not.

| Property | Type | Attribute | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `isLazyLoadEnabled` | boolean | -- | Indicates if Lazy Load feature is enabled. |

```
public boolean isLazyLoadEnabled;  // getter
```

## Methods

### enableLazyLoad

Setter method which enables the Lazy Load feature.

```
public void enableLazyLoad();  // setter
```

### loadLazyAd

Loads the webview of a lazy loaded AdUnit and fires all trackers, including third-party and Mobile SDK trackers.  

```
public void loadLazyAd()
```

## Listener callbacks

### onLazyAdLoaded

**onLazyAdLoaded** is fired when the **loadAd** method successfully returns a lazy loaded AdUnit, that is an AdUnit with an unallocated
webview. All other features of the AdUnit instance are available, including a populated instance of **ANAdResponseInfo**. If **loadAd**
fails, then the same callbacks are used as for an AdUnit that was not lazy loaded.

```
public void onLazyAdLoaded(AdView adView)
```

## Example

```
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?)
{
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_banner_lazy_load)
 
        banner = BannerAdView(this)
        banner.placementID = “1234567”
        banner.setAdSize(300, 250)

        /* native assebly renderer
        banner.setAllowNativeDemand(true)
        banner.enableNativeRendering(true)
        */
 
        banner.enableLazyLoad()
        banner.loadAd()
 }
 
// AdListener Callback method
override fun onLazyAdLoaded(adView: AdView) {
        // Ad is loaded Lazily, Further processing goes here.
}
 
 
// Call this method as per the need, to load the webview content.
banner.loadLazyAd()
 
 
// AdListener Callback method
override fun onAdLoaded(adView: AdView) {
    // Ad loaded, after loadLazyAd() was invoked.
}
```
