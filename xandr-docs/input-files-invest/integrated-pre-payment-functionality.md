the credit card prepayment functionality.

Pre-Payment Functionality enables buyers to make credit card payments

navigate to the Billing interface and once the prepayment invoice
generator form is launched, user can then enter the required information
to generate the Invoice, which can then be downloaded by the user.

    Make a Payment button.

4.  Click on Pay as
    guest to open the credit card payment form in a new
    window.
    

    Customers have the option to sign in as a guest or sign up to
    Plastiq, if they would prefer their details to be saved.

    
5.  Enter the Card Holderâ€™s name, phone number and
    verify if the member ID is accurate, and click on
    Continue.

    billing address and click on

    details.

    details and click on submit
