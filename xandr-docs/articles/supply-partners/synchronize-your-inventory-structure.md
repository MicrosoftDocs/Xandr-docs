# Synchronize Your Inventory Structure



You should synchronize your inventory structure with
Xandr on a regular basis, ideally
programmatically. Tight synchronization allows you to:

- Analyze discrepancies between Xandr and your
  system. 
- Investigate publisher or domain performance.
- Enforce ad quality and publisher blocking preferences to ensure
  that Xandr provides acceptable bids.
- Separate detectable and non-detectable inventory so that the impact of
  non-detectable inventory on overall selling can mitigated. 

If inventory is not properly categorized and becomes non-detectable by
Domain Detection, this will result in the inventory being unsellable via
Xandr, because without proper inventory grouping
and classification Xandr cannot reliably enforce
