# Setting Up 24/7 Media Inventory Through the Microsoft Ad Exchange



The Microsoft Adverting Exchange (MAX) includes Real Media Group
exclusively to 24/7 Open AdStream and Global Web alliances. You can
adjust your campaign and targeting settings to purchase inventory
according to several different scenarios.

Universal Settings

In addition to the steps of setting up targeting as you do for all
campaigns, you must perform the following steps for any scenario
involving the purchase of 24/7 Media inventory through the Microsoft Ad
Exchange:

Create New Campaign/Select Line Item and Scope

When defining the **Campaign Type**, be sure to select
Display and Mobile.

Buying Strategy

Under Buying Strategies in the
Basic Setup section, select
Buy Third-Party Inventory.

Inventory

In the Targeting section, the
following settings must be in place:

- **Inventory Quality** - Click the
  Edit button and check the
  Allow All checkbox in order to allow
  sensitive attributes. Approximately 75% of 24/7 Media inventory is
  currently platform-audited, so excluding sensitive attributes may
  limit your inventory availability.
- **Inventory** - Select the 3rd Party
  Inventory option from the list, then click the Sellers tab in
  the 3rd Party Inventory pane,
  and search for **Microsoft Advertising Exchange (280)**.
  - Select Sellers
  - Search by **Microsoft** and select
    Microsoft Advertising Exchange
    (280) - click the check mark to include it.

Allowlists and blocklists cannot be used with any masked URLs because
you cannot target masked domains. You must include or exclude groups of
URLs through the use of seller bins (defined below).

Selecting Microsoft "Bins"

Bins are granular buckets of web inventory, usually grouped by country
or language. The MSN bins are shown in Xandr
Monetize as "categories." Selecting Microsoft Advertising
Exchange at the Sellers includes all publishers and content categories
under the Microsoft Ad Exchange by default. Under the Publishers &
Categories tab you can exclude either publishers or categories that you
would prefer not to target.

The procedure for working with bins is described in detail on the
<a href="target-inventory-on-the-microsoft-advertising-exchange.md"
class="xref">Target Inventory on the Microsoft Advertising Exchange</a>
page.



<b>Note:</b> bins concern the location of the
inventory, not the location of the user. For example, if you target a
bin of Canadian inventory, your campaign will serve only to users who
are looking at that Canadian inventory.



Targeting

In addition to the settings listed above, you must determine the exact
targeting scenarios that you wish to use. The targeting steps required
to set up the specified scenario are listed below:
