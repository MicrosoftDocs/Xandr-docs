# Impression bus API

Members on the Xandr platform who build their own bidder, either with the bidder framework or from scratch, can configure their integration with the platform via these API Services. For example:

- The [Bidder Service](./bidder-service.md) is used to register a bidder with the impression bus along with its IP address and port and other basic information.
- The [Creative Service](./creative-service.md) is used to submit creatives for quality approval.

To learn more about API Services please start with:

- [API Semantics](./api-semantics.md)
- [Authentication Service](./authentication-service.md)
