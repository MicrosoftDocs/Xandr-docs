# Viewability Targeting



Based on historical viewability data across several dimensions of the ad
call, Xandr has developed a methodology for
determining, pre-auction, the percentage probability that an ad will be
viewable to the user once it is delivered to the page, per the IAB
viewability measurement standards.

You can opt to buy only impressions that have a certain percentage
predicted viewability by checking the **Viewability Threshold** checkbox
in Line Item
 \>  Targeting, and
entering a percentage value.

Predicted viewability is supported for both display (banners) and video
inventory on desktop and mobile web.
