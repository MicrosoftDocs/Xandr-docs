# Microsoft Monetize - Targeting (buy-side)

This page lists the types of user and inventory targeting you can apply
on your line items or campaigns. If a particular kind of targeting is
only available to Standard or Augmented line items, that is stated.
Otherwise, you can assume that the targeting is available to both types
of line items. Augmented line items do not use campaigns.
