# Mediation services

This section describes the Xandr mediation APIs.

> [!NOTE]
> Mediation is only available to Microsoft Monetize Ad Server customers.

Microsoft Monetize Ad Server mediation allows demand from sources not integrated into the Monetize exchange or [Prebid Server Premium](../monetize/prebid-server-premium) to compete for publisher inventory. Both known partners, such as Google, as well as custom networks are supported.

For context on mediation, see [Selling Your Inventory through Mediation](../monetize/mediation-selling-your-inventory-through-mediation).

To get started with mediation using API services, see:

- [Mediated Network Service](./mediated-network-service)
- [Mediated Bid Service](./mediated-bid-service)
 
The following diagram provides a high-level overview of how these API services connect with each other and the outside world.
