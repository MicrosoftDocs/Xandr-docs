# Seller creative review list

The **Seller Creative Review** window lets
sellers review a list of pending, approved, and rejected creatives,
configure list columns, search for creatives to review, and open
creatives in a side pane for more details.

To access the **Seller Creative Review**
window from any Monetize screen:

- If you have a **Publishers** menu:
select **Publishers** \> **Seller Creative Review**
- If you have a **Marketplace** menu:
  select **Marketplace** \> **Seller Creative Review**

## List of creatives

The **Seller Creative Review** window
displays creatives in rows under three status tabs:
**Pending**, **Approved**, and **Rejected**. Creatives appear under each
status tab as follows:

- **Pending** – Creatives that have not
  yet been approved or rejected. Creatives are listed here if they were
  blocked for the seller on a deal in the last 7 days.
- **Approved** – Creatives that have been
  approved by the seller.
- **Rejected** – Creatives that have been
  rejected by the seller. Keeping rejected creatives lets sellers
  initially reject creatives that they might eventually like to run (for
  example, if the creatives require additional information before
  approving).

> [!NOTE]
> You can move creatives from **Approved** to **Rejected** status or from **Rejected** to **Approved** status, but you can’t move them back to **Pending** status. (for more information, see [Approve and Reject Creatives](approve-and-reject-creatives.md)).

## Understand creative columns

The **Pending**, **Approved**, and **Rejected** status tabs each list
creatives in rows. The rows include columns with useful information
about each creative. The following table provides a description of the
available columns.

| Column Name | Description |
|---|---|
| **Avg. CPM Bid** | The average bid for this creative on the seller’s deals in the last 7 days |
| **Brand** | Brand name associated with the creative |
| **Error Count** | The number of errors against this creative on the seller’s deals in the last 7 days |
| **ID** | ID of the creative. |
| **Name** | Name of the creative |
| **Type** | Type of creative, e.g., **Banner**, **Video** |
| **Microsoft Advertising Hosted** | Specifies if Microsoft Advertising is hosting the creative |

## Search for creatives

Using the search box at the top of the **Seller
Creative Review** window, you can search for creatives by ID, type,
brand name, or creative name.

## Use pagination

If you don't have an ID, type, brand name, or creative name to search
on, you can use pagination at the bottom of the
**Seller Creative Review** window to page
through the rows of creatives. You can:

- Select the number of rows to display per page by selecting a value
  from the **Rows per page** menu.
- Enter a specific page in the designated text field or click the arrows
  to navigate from page to page.

## Add or remove columns

You can add or remove columns in the **Seller
Creative Review** window by doing the following:

1. In the **Seller Creative Review**
    window, click **Modify Columns**.
1. In the **Modify Columns** dialog, click the appropriate status tab
    (**Pending**, **Approved**, or **Rejected**).
1. Select (to show) or deselect (to hide) any column checkboxes. You
    can also choose **Select all**/**Deselect
    all** to select or deselect all columns for the status tab.
1. Optionally, you can rearrange the columns by dragging and dropping
    them in the **Modify Columns** dialog.

## View creative details

**Seller Creative Review** window, click

  values
