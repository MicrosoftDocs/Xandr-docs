# Find an order line

You can search for a specific order line, or search all order lines to find at-risk line items that you can then optimize.

1. On the **Orders** tab, in the Orders Tasks panel, click **Find Order Lines**. A list of all of the current month's order lines appears. These are filtered by default to show all line items except those that have been cancelled.
1. (Optional) On the Filter panel, specify any filter criteria:
    - To filter the orders list by date: Click **This Month** in the Date Range filter. Specify a standard or custom time period. Click **Update**.
    - To filter the order list by status: Click **Includes x Values** in the Status filter. Click on a status to select or deselect it. Click **Update**.
    - To filter the list on the type of contract (e.g., sponsorship or bulk): Click **None Selected** in the Contract Type filter. Click on one or more contract types to select them. Click **Update**.
    - To filter the list on the inventory (e.g., guaranteed): Click **None Selected** in the Inventory Class filter. Click on one or more types of inventory to select them. Click **Update**.
1. In the search box in the toolbar above the order list, type a search term. Change the search options as needed, and then press **Enter**. The order list is redisplayed to show only the orders that match your search criteria.
    - By default, the search returns orders that contain the search term you entered. To change the type of search, on the drop-down list
      to the left of the search box, click **Contains** and select a different option (e.g., to search for orders that starts with the
      search term you typed, select **Starts With**).
    - By default, the search is run against the advertiser, order name, order ID, order line, and order line ID. To narrow the search to
      just one of these, click **All** in the drop-down list to the right of the search box and select a different option (e.g., to search for orders by order name only, select **Order**).
1. To drill into the high-level details of an order line (Status, Salesperson, what it was Sold As, and the Target Expression), click to the left of the order line name.

> [!TIP]
> From within the order line search results, you can:
>
> - View the details of an order line – Click a order line's name in the **Order Line** column to open the Order Line Visibility page.
>
> - Add an order line to a scenario – To the left of the order line, click, and then select **Add to Scenario**.
