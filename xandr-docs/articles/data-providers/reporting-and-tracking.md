# Reporting and tracking

## Reporting

Xandr does not provide segment usage reporting for data providers direct clearing with data buyers (i.e. there is no reporting for data providers outside of the Data Marketplace). The reports that are available in show various metrics for the delivery of advertisers, insertion order, line items, and creatives. Currently, grouping by segment targeted is not available on these reports. If a data provider wishes to receive a report on the delivery per campaign targeting their segments, they should work with the data buyer to [schedule delivery of a report](reporting-instructions.md) to be emailed from.

## Tracking

The most common methods used for tracking the user of shared segments are impression pixels and client reporting.

- **Impression Pixels:** Impression pixels can be associated with each creative that is served by a campaign using the shared segments to target users/inventory. The impression pixel will call your servers each time the creative is served, informing you of the number of impressions served against the segments.
- **Click Trackers:** It is possible to insert another link in the click tracking chain which will redirect the user to an external click tracker, giving you visibility into the performance of a campaign.
- **Conversion Trackers:** It is possible to redirect from aÂ conversion pixel to an external conversion tracker, giving you visibility into the performance of a campaign.
    > [!NOTE]
    > You will be responsible for performing attribution related to this conversion tracker.
- **Client Reporting:** Data recipients may schedule or otherwise send reports to the data provider for campaigns and line items utilizing the shared segments for targeting. For steps on how clients can schedule usage reports to be delivered to the data provider see [Reporting Instructions](reporting-instructions.md).
