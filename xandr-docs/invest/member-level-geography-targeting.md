# Member-level geography targeting

When you apply member-level targeting, the settings will be applied globally to all line items for all advertisers under the member.

**Geography Targeting** allows you to create of a list of countries from which your campaigns will be able to purchase impressions through open exchange. Defining this list allows you to be more efficient when setting up your line items because you will have a smaller set of countries from which to select for your **Geography** setting.

> [!NOTE]
> These settings apply only to inventory bought through open exchange. They have no impact on managed inventory.

## Get started

Geography settings are available from the **Member Settings** screen (hover over your member name in the upper-right corner of the menu bar and click **Member Settings**).

From the **Member Settings** screen, you can view any settings that have already been applied.

To add or modify the settings, click the edit icon (the pencil) next to **Geography Targeting** to open the **Edit Geography Targeting** window.

## Add or modify geography settings

To add a country:

1. From the **Edit Geography Targeting** window, type the name of the country you want to add. As you type, countries matching the entered text appear.
1. Select the country you want to add. The country will appear in the **Selected** list below the search box.
1. Click **Save**.

To remove a country:

1. From the **Edit Geography Targeting** window, click the **X** to the right of any country in the **Selected** list you want to remove.
1. Click **Save**.
