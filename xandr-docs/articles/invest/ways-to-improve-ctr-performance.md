# Ways to Improve Click-Through Rate (CTR) Performance



You can always adjust your line item setup to improve its CTR
performance, even after setting a CTR optimization goal.



Consider the following CTR improvement options when editing your line
item:

a CTR optimization goal to your line
item, and set Goal Priority to <span

<td class="entry"
headers="ways-to-improve-ctr-performance__table_sbc_pfz_jgb__entry__2">If
you haven't already done so, adding a CTR optimization goal when
creating or editing a line item ensures that your line item prioritizes
delivery on high-performing CTR inventory. Simultaneously, adding a CTR
goal reduces or otherwise eliminates delivery to low-performing CTR
inventory. Changing your line item Goal
Priority to Performance should
also further improve CTR performance.

<b>Note:</b> There is always a chance that
delivery will be affected as inventory is assessed and potentially
discarded, but if you feel as though you have a large enough inventory
and impression pool to transact on, then adding a CTR optimization goal
shouldn't create underdelivery issues for you. You can
use Planner to verify how much inventory is available to your line item
when these settings are hypothetically enabled. For more information on
using the planning tool, see <a href="create-and-activate-a-plan.md"
