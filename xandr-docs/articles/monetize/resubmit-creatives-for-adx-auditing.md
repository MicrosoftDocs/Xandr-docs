# Resubmit Creatives for Google Ad Manager Auditing



You may receive a rejection reason directly from Google's API if your
creative is rejected by Google Ad Manager. You can easily resubmit your
rejected creative to Google Ad Manager so that it can be re-audited.

>

Find the reason that was provided using the table within
<a href="adx-disapproval-reasons.md" class="xref"
title="You may receive a disapproval reason from Google Ad Manager for various reasons.">Google
Ad Manager Disapproval Reasons</a>. Once you have an understanding of
the issue that Google Ad Manager found, review your creative and its
settings to confirm the validity of Google's rejection reason.



<b>Note:</b> Creatives can have a Google Ad
Manager audit status of "pending" for an indefinite period. Because
Xandr is not performing the Google Ad Manager
audit, we can't guarantee a turnaround time on Google Ad Manager audit
statuses. For any issues related to the Google Ad Manager audit, please
contact Google Ad Manager.

1.  If your creative does not comply with Google's

    href="http://support.google.com/adxbuyer/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1325008"
    class="xref" target="_blank">Ad Exchange Policies</a>, revise your
    creative to meet the necessary requirements.
    

    Revision could involve modifying the creative file itself or
    changing settings associated with your creative. For API users, it
    could also involve using the <a
    href="xandr-api/creative-service.md"
    class="xref" target="_blank">Creative Service</a>. For more
    information, see the
    Recommendation column in the table
    within <a href="adx-disapproval-reasons.md" class="xref"
    title="You may receive a disapproval reason from Google Ad Manager for various reasons.">Google
    Ad Manager Disapproval Reasons</a>.

    
2.  Resubmit your creative for audit.
    

    This will automatically trigger a resubmission for Google Ad Manager
    audit, so there's no need to file a support ticket asking for
    reaudit. Within 24 hours of resubmitting, a revised Google Ad
    Manager status should be presented to you. If it fails again, repeat
    these steps. If your Google Ad Manager audit continues to fail,
    please work with Google Ad Manager to resolve the issue.
