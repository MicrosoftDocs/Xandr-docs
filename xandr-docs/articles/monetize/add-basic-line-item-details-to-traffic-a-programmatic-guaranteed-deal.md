# Add Basic Line Item Details to Traffic a Programmatic Guaranteed Deal



You can associate one or more insertion orders to the programmatic
guaranteed line item, create a deal for a buyer, as well as set an ad
type, name, and state, all from the Basic
Setup section.

<div id="add-basic-line-item-details-to-traffic-a-programmatic-guaranteed-deal__steps_svt_m14_3mb"

1.  Associate insertion orders to the line item by
    doing the following:
    1.  Click
        Edit.
        

        A list of corresponding insertion orders displays automatically.

        
    2.  Search for additional existing insertion
        orders if necessary.
    3.  Select the corresponding check marks to
        associate the necessary insertion orders that display.
        

        

        Note: To use PG selling line
        items, you need to create and associate a **seamless insertion
        order** with no end date, no budget, and an
        Impression revenue type.

        

        
    4.  Click
        Save.
2.  Select the appropriate
    Ad Type.
    

    <div id="add-basic-line-item-details-to-traffic-a-programmatic-guaranteed-deal__note_z5s_n1y_k5b"
    

    Note: You can currently only use
    banner creatives in your PG deal without
    Xandr representative assistance. If you'd
    like to use other creative types, please contact your
    Xandr account representative.

    

    

    - Banner
    - Video (Audio)
    - Native

    

    The ad type must match the type of creative(s) that the buyer
    intends to traffic.

    
3.  If you want, enable
    Roadblocking.
    1.  Select a size for the
        Master creative.
    2.  Select a size for the
        Companion creative.
    3.  If necessary, click
        Add Companions to include
        additional companion creatives and select their sizes.

    

    Roadblocking allows buyers to
    serve multiple creatives together on the same page. When you use
    seller tags to conduct a single auction for multiple ad slots on a
    page, you can serve multiple linked creatives.
    

    Note: Programmatic roadblocks are
    currently a **Closed Beta** feature, so some clients don't have
    access to it. If you'd like access to this feature, please contact
    your account representative.

    

    
4.  Specify the ad size(s) of your banner creatives
    (**required** only if you selected
    Banner for
    Ad Type).
    1.  Click the pencil icon.
    2.  Choose either
        Include all sizes or
        Specific sizes...
        

        You will be asked to select
        Standard and/or
        Custom ad sizes if you
        chose Specific sizes....

        
    3.  Click
        Save.
5.  Enter the name you will use to search for and
    report on the line item.
6.  Click +External
    Code and enter a code if you want to report on a line item
    using your own code (rather than the internal ID that
    Xandr assigns automatically). 
    

    External codes must follow these guidelines:
    - They can contain only alphanumeric characters, periods,
      underscores or dashes.
    - Codes are not case-sensitive (upper- and lower-case characters are
      treated the same).
    - No two objects can use the same code per advertiser. For example,
      two line items cannot both use code "ABC."

    
7.  Set the
    State.
8.  Create a deal.
    1.  Enter a Deal
        Name.
    2.  Select
        Buyers - Click
        Edit under
        Buyer to choose buyers for
        your new deal.
    3.  On the
        Select Buyer screen,
        select your desired buyers (you can search by
        Name and
        ID). 
        

        

        Warning: After creating the
        deal, you cannot change the selected buyer.

        

        
    4.  Click
        Add.
    5.  Code -
        (Optional) Enter a custom deal code in **Code** (typically used
        by external buyers for deal mapping).
    6.  Description
        - (Optional) Enter a description for your deal in
        the **Description **box.
9.  Enter a Fixed
    Price for Revenue
    Type.
    

    

    Note: PG selling line items must
    have a CPM revenue type.
    Fixed Price pertains to deals
    where the line item competes in the auction at a fixed price
    whenever the buyer bids above that price.

    

    
10. Set a
    Budget.
    1.  Enter an amount for each flight and adjust
        the % of daily average
        allocation as necessary using the slider.
        

        PG selling line items can only be set to
        Lifetime Budget.

        
11. Set
    Flight.
    

    Enter your desired flight dates.
    

    Note: Only one flight can be made
    currently for PG selling line items.

    

    
12. Choose a
    Priority.
    1.  Select a priority level
        (1-5: Open Auction,
        6-20: Private Auction) for the
        PG selling line item in the Line
        Item Priority drop-down.
        

        The priority level you set determines the **Auction Type** for
        the deal line item and the order in which bids are considered at
        auction. For more information, see
        <a href="deal-auction-mechanics.html" class="xref">Deal Auction
        Mechanics</a>.
        

        Note: PG selling line items
        require a Managed supply
        strategy.
