# Customer Support Portal Guide





Note: If you have a portal account,
please contact Customer Support only through
the <a href="https://help.xandr.com/" class="xref" target="_blank">Customer
Support Portal</a> instead of using older methods or opening a case by
email.



The <a href="https://help.xandr.com/" class="xref" target="_blank">Customer
Support Portal</a> lets you search a customer support knowledge base of
common questions and tasks, and create, update, and review support
cases.The Support Knowledge Base contains articles that answer common
questions and explain how to troubleshoot common issues and perform
common tasks. Knowledge base articles often link to the
<a href="https://docs.xandr.com/" class="xref" target="_blank"><span
class="ph"> docs portal</a> for more detailed information or more
complicated tasks. The
<a href="https://docs.xandr.com/" class="xref" target="_blank">docs
portal</a> provides an exhaustive overview of 
concepts and features. It includes product documentation, developer and
API documentation, and other artifacts.

This guide provides instructions on how to use the Customer Support
Portal.
