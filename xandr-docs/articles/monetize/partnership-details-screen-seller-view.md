# Partnership Details Screen - Seller View



On the Partnership details screen you can review and manage your
relationship with a specific buyer. You can track overall revenue
trends, view the buyer's top brands on your inventory, view your top
publishers for the buyer, view the privileges you have granted for the
buyer, view active and upcoming deals, and create new deals for buyers.

Getting to the Partnership Details Screen

**Publisher clients**: Select
Marketplace
 \>  Partner Center.
**All other clients**: Select
Partners
\>  Partner Center.

Then click on a buyer.

Viewing Buyer Contact Info and Description

View information the buyer has provided, including the main contact's
name, phone number, and email address, and a description of their
business. You can contact the buyer directly in
Monetize by sending a message within the
Activity Stream. For more information about the Activity Stream, see <a
href="partnership-details-screen-seller-view.md#ID-000006c3__p-b7f513e7-2f34-4371-b69f-20878e760ad4"
class="xref">Communicating with the Buyer.</a>



<b>Important:</b>

If the buyer has not entered their contact's name, phone number, email
address, or a description of their business, then this information will
not be available.



Viewing Buyer Performance on Your Inventory

View statistics in the Dashboard to
see how the buyer is performing on your inventory. These statistics are
updated every 24 hours. The graph and two tables may update at separate
times, therefore text at the top of each section notes when the last
update occurred.



<b>Note:</b> If the buyer has not purchased
any inventory from you, there will be no information to appear in the
chart and tables on the Dashboard.



Revenue from Buyer

A graph displays revenue from all transactions between you and the buyer
within the last 90 days. You can use this graph to monitor the buyer's
activity on your inventory. If the buyer is targeting an active deal,
this graph can help give you insight into the deal's effectiveness.
Since the revenue displayed here reflects all transactions, this graph
will not help you keep track of the revenue from a specific deal.

There is a data point for every day. Hover over a data point to see the
date it represents, along with the amount of revenue and impressions for
that day.

Revenue by Top Brands

A table lists the buyer's top brands that have purchased your inventory,
listed in order from most to least revenue. This information tells you
which of the buyer's brands are performing best on your inventory.

Revenue by Top Publishers

A table lists your top publishers that the buyer has purchased inventory
from, listed in order from most to least revenue. This information tells
you which of your publishers are performing best with the buyer.

**Communicating with the Buyer**

In the Activity Stream, the
Messages tab shows messages between
you and the buyer along with the number of days since the message was
posted. You can use the Activity
Stream to introduce yourself to a new buyer, offer targeting
access in exchange for increased spend, check in with the buyer to see
how their targeting access is working for them, or request changes to
your eligibility and inventory trust.

In this section you can:

- **Send a message:** Send the buyer a message by typing into the field
  at the top of the section, and then clicking
  Post. When you post a new message,
  the system sends a notification to the contact in the buyer's profile.
- **View last update information:** Text at the top of the section notes
  when the Activity Stream was last
  updated.
- **Hide Activity Stream:** Click the Hide Activity Stream icon (double
  arrows) to collapse the section and provide more working space for you
  to use the Dashboard,
  Partner Controls, or
  Deals tabs.

Click on the Notifications tab in the
Activity Stream to view system
messages.

performing. If the number of deal impressions you have shown to the
buyer is low, there may be an issue with your deal settings or with your
inventory. If the number of deal impressions the buyer has bid on is
low, the buyer may have campaign setup issues.
