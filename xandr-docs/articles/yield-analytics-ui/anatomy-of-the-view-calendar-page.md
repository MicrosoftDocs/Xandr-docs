# Anatomy of the View Calendar Page



The View Calendar page on
the Availability tab shows a daily
summary of future availability by month.



## About the View Calendar Interface

The View Calendar page can be displayed in two views:

- Calendar view – This is the default view for the page and shows a
  high-level graphical representation of the availability for a given
  month. You can mouse over each day to see a breakdown of capacity,
  availability, and sell-through information, as well as the number of
  booked, pending, and proposed order lines.
- List view – This drill-down view shows each day in the month as a row
  in a table. You can expand and collapse rows as needed to see full
  details on the order lines scheduled for that day.

To the left of the daily summary is the Filter panel, where you define
how you want availability to be displayed and based on what criteria. 

Above the daily summary is a toolbar, where you can switch between views
and select the month for which you want to see availability. You can
also export the data from the daily summary to an Excel spreadsheet
(XLS) or comma-separated values (CSV) file.
