    <b>Tip:</b> Creatives that have not served or
    been modified within the last 90 days are good candidates for deletion.
    To find such creatives, click the Advanced
    Filter button, select the Last 90
    days radio button from the Last
    modified section in the <span
    class="keyword wintitle">Filters dialog, and click <span
    class="ph uicontrol">Apply. Deletions are permanent and cannot be
    reverted. In the case where a deleted creative was the only creative
    that was associated to an active line item, the
    line item will not serve. Although deleted
    creatives continue to be available in reporting, you will no longer have
    visibility into their specific settings such as third-party URL or tag,
    impression tracking pixels, and creative attributes.
