# Microsoft Curate - October 20, 2025 - Bulk edit deals 

We are pleased to announce that bulk deal editing for Microsoft Curate is now available to all customers, where certain aspects of curated deals can be edited in bulk through the Microsoft Curate user interface to efficiently manage monetization. This UI workflow enhancement reduces the time needed to manage deals at scale, enabling curators to focus on value-add activities and driving spend. 

This enhancement allows editing various aspects of multiple deals in a single view: 
- Deal name 
- Margin 
- Price 
- Viewability threshold 

You can access the feature from the **Package > Curated Deal** screen, where selecting multiple deals now reveals a bulk edit option in the action bar.
