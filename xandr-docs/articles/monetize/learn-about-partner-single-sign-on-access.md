# Learn About Partner Single Sign-on Access



<div class="p h2">


<b>Note:</b> This feature is no longer
available. To integrate your company's SSO with Microsoft Identity
Platform and to access the Xandr products, see

What is Partner Single Sign-on?



Partner single sign-on allows users to use their own company/corporate
Identity Provider (IDP) username and password to access
Xandr systems and tools. This service allows you
full control over the authentication of your user accounts that can
access Microsoft Monetize. Basically,
Xandr acts as the service provider for
Microsoft Monetize. Xandr
clients act as Identity Providers (IDPs) and control usernames,
passwords and other information used to identify, authenticate and
authorize users for Microsoft Monetize.



<b>Tip:</b> Partner single sign-on only
applies to Microsoft Monetize at this time. Users
who gain access via the application programming interface (API) will not
be able to use Xandr's SSO solution at this
time.



Why Would I Choose Partner Single Sign-on?

Partner SSO provides additional security and usability by providing:

- Auto creation of user accounts
- Permission control within your IDP
- Revocation of user access to Xandr accounts
  via your own systems

Prerequisites/Caveats for Onboarding

- Single sign-on is only supported at this time for
  Microsoft Monetize and for users not enabled for
  the API.
- Xandr only supports single sign-on for one
  user account per IDP entity.
- It is currently possible to have Partner SSO users and non-partner SSO
  users under the same member.

How Do I Get Started?

Contact your Account Manager or the
<a href="https://help.appnexus.com/s/login/" class="xref"

inform them that you would like to sign up for single sign-on.
