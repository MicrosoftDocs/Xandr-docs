# Fee Calculations



When you create a
<a href="partner-fees.md" class="xref">partner fee</a>, the fee can be
based on percentage or CPM. CPM fees are always deducted from revenue.
Revshare fees may be calculated in multiple ways:

- Deducted from revenue
- Added to net or gross media cost
- Added to media cost and data cost

Gross media cost includes the

Auction Service Charge</a> (BASC). Net media cost covers only pure media
cost.



<b>Note:</b> Line item currency is inherited
from the advertiser. If a fee is created in a currency other than the
line item currency, then we will automatically convert the fee to the
line item currency at the time of transaction.
