# Create a Legacy Insertion Order





Note: Legacy insertion orders are
required for <a href="create-a-guaranteed-delivery-line-item.html"
class="xref">Create a Guaranteed Delivery Line Item</a>. For all other
line items, we recommend the use of the
<a href="create-an-insertion-order.html" class="xref">Create an
Insertion Order</a>.



Insertion orders allow you to easily manage collections of line items
that may share a common budget, time span, and business terms. Insertion
orders are a standard part of the
<a href="object-hierarchy.html" class="xref">Object Hierarchy</a>. An
insertion order can contain one line item or many line items. The
instructions in this topic apply to a now-deprecated type of insertion
order. The legacy insertion order:

- Is not compatible with augmented line items (ALIs).
- Uses flight dates, not billing periods.

If you currently use legacy insertion orders, you should consider making
the transition to standard (formerly seamless) insertion orders and
augmented line items soon.



Important: You can only create
insertion orders under advertisers for which insertion orders are
enabled. See <a href="create-an-advertiser.html" class="xref">Create an
Advertiser</a> for more details.



Select the advertiser

On the Advertisers screen
(Advertisers
 \>  All Advertisers),
click the name of the advertiser under which you want to create an
insertion order.

Create a new insertion order

On the Advertiser Details screen
of the advertiser under which you want to create an insertion, click
Create New
 \>  Insertion Order.

The Create New Insertion Order
screen is then displayed. Define all relevant details for your insertion
order.



Tip: You can expand or collapse each
section as needed. To expand or collapse all sections at once, click the
Expand All or
Collapse All link in the upper right.



Enter basic details and flight dates

In the Basic Setup section, enter
the basic details and flight dates for the insertion order.

- Name - Enter the name for the
  insertion order. You will later be able to search for and report on
  the insertion order using this name.
- External Code - If you want to
  report on the insertion order using an external code (rather than the
  internal ID that Xandr assigns automatically),
  enter the code here. The code may only contain alphanumeric
  characters, periods, underscores or dashes. The code you enter is not
  case-sensitive (upper- and lower-case characters are treated the
  same). No two objects at the same level (e.g., line items or
  campaigns) can use the same code per advertiser. For example, two line
  items cannot both use code "XYZ", but a single line item and its child
  campaign can.
- Billing Code - Enter any internal
  billing code you want to associate with this insertion order. If you
  receive an invoice per insertion order, the code you enter here will
  appear on that invoice. For details on invoices, see
  <a href="understanding-your-invoice.html" class="xref"
  title="Annotated descriptions of the contents of your Xandr invoices.">Understanding
  Your Invoice</a>.
- State - Set the state of the
  insertion order. If "Active", child line items and campaigns will be
  eligible to serve. However, it is best practice to set the state to
  "Inactive" until everything related to the buy has been set up and
  verified. This will avoid spending before you are ready.
- Currency - The currency is inherited
  from the advertiser, but you can set a different currency for the
  insertion order, if necessary. Note that you cannot change the
  currency after saving the insertion order.
  

  Note: As a best practice, align
  currency to the billing currency in order to achieve the best possible
  local currency experience. Read
  <a href="currency-support.html" class="xref">Currency Support</a> for
  more details.

  
- Viewability Standard - The criteria
  by which an impression is measured as viewable. Please see
  <a href="introduction-to-viewability.html" class="xref">Introduction to
  Viewability</a> for more information.
- Flight Dates - Enter or select the
  start and end dates and times for the insertion order. By default, the
  start date is today, the start time is now, and the insertion order is
  set to run indefinitely (no end date/time). To set a specific end date
  and time, deselect Run indefinitely.
  Note that the time format (12-hour or 24-hour) and time zone are
  inherited from the advertiser.
  

  Important: You can set flight dates
  for each line item and campaign under the insertion order as well, but
  your insertion order flight dates take precedence. When you reach the
  insertion order end date, all line items and campaigns under the
  insertion order will stop buying impressions, whether or not they have
  reached their own end dates.

  

Set the insertion order budget

By default, your insertion order **Budget** is "Unlimited." If you
prefer, you can define exactly how much the advertiser has allocated for
you to spend over the lifetime of the insertion order and/or on any
single day. The budget can be in **impressions** or in **revenue**
(money).

- Lifetime - This is the budget that
  the advertiser has allocated for you to spend over the entire lifetime
  of the insertion order. There are two options:
  - Custom - Select this option to
    enter a specific amount of impressions or money.
  - Unlimited - Select this option to
    leave your lifetime budget undefined.
- Daily - This is the budget that the
  advertiser has allocated for you to spend on any single day. There are
  three options:
  - Custom - Select this option to
    enter a specific amount of impressions or money.

  - Pace Lifetime Budget - Select this
    option to spread your lifetime budget evenly across your flight
    dates. As each day passes, the system spreads the remaining
    impression or revenue budget across the remaining days of the
    flight.

    The system is not able to pace its spending if it does not have a
    budget amount, and the system must know the number of days in the
    insertion order in order to apply the remaining budget amount
    equally for the remainder of the flight. Therefore, this option
    requires that you enter a custom lifetime budget and select an end
    date. For more details, examples, and best practices, see
    <a href="lifetime-pacing.html" class="xref"
    title="Lifetime pacing intelligently distributes a budget over the lifespan of a line item&#39;s flight.">Lifetime
    Pacing</a>.

  - Unlimited - Select this option to
    leave your daily budget undefined.



Important: You can set budgets at the
line item, campaign, and creative levels as well, but your insertion
order budget takes precedence. When your insertion order budget runs
out, all line items and campaigns under the insertion order will stop
buying impressions, whether or not they have reached their own budgets.
For more details about budgeting and best practices, see
<a href="budgeting-and-pacing.html" class="xref">Budgeting and
Pacing</a>.

Acknowledgement  
You must check **I certify that all information provided herein is
accurate and up to date, and acknowledge and agree that is relying on

order.

Enter reporting labels (optional)

In the Reporting Labels section, you
can associate a Trafficker,
Sales Rep, and/or
Insertion Order Type to the insertion
order. This enables you to report on performance by these labels in
<a href="network-reporting.html" class="xref">Network Reporting</a>.

For example, you might associate a Trafficker with each insertion order
and then run a report grouped by Trafficker to find out which ones are
responsible for which insertion orders or compare insertion order
performance across traffickers. For more details, see
<a href="reporting-labels.html" class="xref">Reporting Labels</a>.

Add commissions (optional)

If you need to attribute revenue to third parties, you can add fees in
the Commissions section. Commissions
are deducted from the booked revenue (the amount the advertiser pays
you) of each line item under the insertion order, and can be defined
either as a percentage of booked revenue or a flat CPM.



Note: Commissions at the line item
level override commissions at the insertion order level.



To add a new commission:

1.  Click the Add Fee button to
    display the additional fields.
2.  In the Broker field, select the
    relevant broker or create a new broker.
3.  In the Description field, enter
    details about the commission.
4.  Select the Fee Type (**CPM** or
    **Revenue Share**) and enter the relevant **Fee Value** (dollar
    amount for **CPM**, percentage for **Revenue Share**).
5.  Click Add.



Important: Per broker, you can add no
more than one CPM commission and one Revenue Share commission.





Note: The commissions here apply to all
line items under the insertion order. If you prefer, you can add
commissions to specific line items instead. See
<a href="create-a-standard-line-item.html" class="xref">Create a
Standard Line Item</a> for more details.





Note: The decimal position support for
the broker fees is for 1 place after the decimal. For example, if you
set 16.67% as a broker fee in the **Commissions** section, after saving,
the value would round off to 16.7%. However, there is no restriction on
number of places after the decimal if the <a
href="https://docs.xandr.com/bundle/xandr-api/page/insertion-order-service.html"
class="xref" target="_blank">Insertion Order service API</a> is used to
create the broker fee.



Associate line items (optional)

In the Associated Line Items section,
you can associate existing line items to the insertion order. Note that
you can do this when creating or editing a line item as well.



Important: When you associate a line
item to an insertion order, any budget or impressions that occurred
under the line item before it was associated to the insertion order do
not count towards the lifetime budget of the insertion order. For
example, if you have Line Item XYZ that spent $100,000 of budget before
you associate it to Insertion Order ABC with a lifetime budget of
$250,000, the insertion order will not stop serving until the line item
reaches $350,000 ($100,000 before being associated to the insertion
order, and $250,000 after).



To associate existing line items:

1.  Click the Edit button.
2.  Check the line items that you want to associate to the insertion
    order.
3.  Click Add.

Enter comments (optional)

In the Comments section, enter any
comments that you would like to record with the insertion order.
Comments are for your reference only and will not affect delivery.

Save the insertion order

To finish adding the insertion order, click the
Save button. You're then taken to the
<a href="view-insertion-order-details.html" class="xref"
title="The Insertion Order Details screen displays settings for a specific insertion order, essential metrics, and performance visualizations.">View
Insertion Order Details</a>.

You can also click the arrow next to the
Save button and choose to **Save and
Create Line Item**. Clicking this option will take you to the
**Create New Line Item** page,
with the newly-created insertion order already selected.
