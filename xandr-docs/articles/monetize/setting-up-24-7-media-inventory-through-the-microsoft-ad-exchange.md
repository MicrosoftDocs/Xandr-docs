# Setting up 24/7 media inventory through the microsoft ad exchange

The Microsoft Adverting Exchange (MAX) includes Real Media Group exclusively to 24/7 Open AdStream and Global Web alliances. You canadjust your campaign and targeting settings to purchase inventory according to several different scenarios.

## Universal settings

In addition to the steps of setting up targeting as you do for all campaigns, you must perform the following steps for any scenario involving the purchase of 24/7 Media inventory through the Microsoft Ad Exchange:

## Create new campaign/select line item and scope

When defining the **Campaign Type**, be sure to select **Display and Mobile**.

## Buying strategy

Under **Buying Strategies** in the **Basic Setup** section, select **Buy Third-Party Inventory**.

## Inventory

In the **Targeting** section, the following settings must be in place:

- **Inventory Quality** - Click the **Edit** button and check the **Allow All** checkbox in order to allow sensitive attributes. Approximately 75% of 24/7 Media inventory is currently platform-audited, so excluding sensitive attributes may limit your inventory availability.
- **Inventory** - Select the **3rd Party Inventory** option from the list, then click the Sellers tab in the 3rd Party Inventory pane, and search for **Microsoft Advertising Exchange (280)**.
  - Select **Sellers**
  - Search by **Microsoft** and select **Microsoft Advertising Exchange (280)** - click the check mark to include it.

Allowlists and blocklists cannot be used with any masked URLs because you cannot target masked domains. You must include or exclude groups of URLs through the use of seller bins (defined below).

## Selecting Microsoft "Bins"

Bins are granular buckets of web inventory, usually grouped by country or language. The MSN bins are shown in Microsoft Monetize as "categories." Selecting Microsoft Advertising Exchange at the Sellers includes all publishers and content categories under the Microsoft Ad Exchange by default. Under the Publishers & Categories tab you can exclude either publishers or categories that you would prefer not to target.

The procedure for working with bins is described in detail on the [Target Inventory on the Microsoft Advertising Exchange](target-inventory-on-the-microsoft-advertising-exchange.md).

> [!NOTE]
> bins concern the location of the inventory, not the location of the user. For example, if you target a bin of Canadian inventory, your campaign will serve only to users who
> are looking at that Canadian inventory.

## Targeting

In addition to the settings listed above, you must determine the exact targeting scenarios that you wish to use. The targeting steps required to set up the specified scenario are listed below:
