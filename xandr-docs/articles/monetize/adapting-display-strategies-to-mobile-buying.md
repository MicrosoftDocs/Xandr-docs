Create Separate Mobile Apps and Mobile Web Campaigns

As described on the
<a href="technical-limitations-of-mobile-buying.html"
class="xref">Technical Limitations of Mobile Buying</a>, mobile apps
cannot be platform-reviewed. However, you might still want to serve on
platform-reviewed mobile web inventory. In this case, you should
separate campaigns targeting apps from those targeting mobile web
inventory.



Note: It is up to the sellers to
declare the supply type for their placements. In other words, this is
not a part of the Xandr platform review process.
Some sellers may not describe their placements' supply type accurately.
For this reason, it's best practice to set mobile web campaigns to
include both mobile web and web supply.



To target a range of mobile inventory, select multiple inventory types -
for example, phones and tablets - for your supply type.

Mobile Specific Reporting and Targeting

In general, it is best to start by optimize your targeting for the
broadest reach, then use the data you have gathered via reporting and by
reviewing delivery and performance to optimize towards better
performance without sacrificing delivery.

<a href="mobile-specific-reporting.html" class="xref">Mobile-Specific
Reporting</a> can be a big help when assessing performance and delivery.
Available fields and dimensions include **Device Type**, **Device
Make**, **Device Model**, **Carrier**, and **Apps Lists**.

- When creating an app list, try to use clear, explicit names, for
  example "Premium Apps - Allowlist" or "Poorly-performing Apps for
  Advertiser XYZ - Blocklist". When you set up your targeting, you will
  have to choose between multiple app lists, and you will find clear
  names useful.
- Unfortunately some impressions don't pass us the App ID, and appear in
  reporting as "---". In order to avoid serving on unidentified apps,
  you may want to use allowlists.

Mobile, Cookies and Device ID: Carefully monitor your frequency capping
strategy

<a href="technical-limitations-of-mobile-buying.html"
class="xref">Technical Limitations of Mobile Buying</a> covers some key
challenges of mobile user tracking. For example, unlike display buying,
it may be hard to apply frequency capping as some apps don't pass along
the Device ID.

To avoid limiting your reach and missing out on cheap but valuable
inventory, you can follow the steps below.

1.  Gather data by launching campaigns where frequency capping is turned
    off.
2.  Once you have gathered enough data, create a
    <a href="creative-frequency-and-recency-report.html"
    class="xref">Creative Frequency and Recency Report</a>.
3.  Based on the data, decide which campaigns should have frequency
    capping to optimize performance, and which campaigns should run
    without frequency capping to extend reach.
