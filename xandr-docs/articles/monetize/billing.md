# Billing



For real-time inventory, Xandr serves as the
clearinghouse by paying inventory sellers and then billing buyers.
Networks and direct marketers pay their managed publishers directly.
This section provides resources for accessing and understanding your
billing information.



<b>Important:</b> To view the Billing
dashboard, your account must be assigned to the
Financial Observer role. Contact your
Xandr representative if you do not have the
correct access.



Network users with Financial
Observer or Financial Admin roles can access past invoices,
seller statements, and credit status, as well as pricing terms (used
when calculating fees and charges on invoices) directly in
Monetize.



## Viewing or Downloading Your Invoices and/or Seller Statements

To access past invoices, select
Network
\> Billing in the menu bar.

Billing periods reflect periods of platform activity. For example, a
June invoice reflects your platform activity in June. However, you may
not receive the invoice until July.

For each billing period listed, you can click to view the invoice and/or
seller statement. Invoices and seller statements available in
Monetize are identical to the invoices you
receive (via email) from Xandr.

For a detailed explanation of the fields and values in an invoice or
seller statement, see
<a href="understanding-your-invoice.md" class="xref"
title="Annotated descriptions of the contents of your Xandr invoices.">Understanding
Your Invoice</a>  or
<a href="understanding-your-seller-statement.md"
class="xref">Understanding Your Seller Statement</a>.





## Viewing Your Pricing Terms

For a quick overview of the pricing terms that go into calculating the
fees and charges in your invoices and statements, select
Network
 \>  Billing in the menu
bar and then click Pricing Terms on
the left.

For more details about pricing terms, review your contract or see
<a href="understanding-your-pricing-terms.md" class="xref"

## Viewing Which Users Have Access to Billing Information

To view the list of users who have access to billing information in
Monetize, switch to
Network 
\>  User Management  \>
 Users in the menu bar and then
click Filter by Role.





## Giving Users Access to Billing Information

Only Network-level users can be given access to
billing information. Currently, there are two ways to
do so:

1.  Make the Network user an Admin. Note that
    this grants the user the ability to install apps as well as view
    billing information. For more details, see
    <a href="create-a-user.md" class="xref">Create a User</a>.
2.  If you don't want to make the user a general Admin, reach out to
    your Xandr representative for assistance.





## Checking your Credit Status

To review the credit status of your account and/or the balance or
unbilled activity of your member, select
Billing under your Member settings.
Click the Credit Status tab.

The information displayed on this tab is divided into two sections,
those that apply to your member and those that apply to your parent
account. There may be more than one member per account.
