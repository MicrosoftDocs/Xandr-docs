## Notes on using the template

- The External Target ID or **Target Expression** should be filled out. The ID is used to lookup targeting: If both fields are completed, the targeting expression is used.
- Only order lines that have all of the required details completed are imported, all others will be excluded. (This also applies to invalid targeting expressions.)
- All orders created via Evaluate Orders (Deal Planner) will appear in the **Orders** table with a Proposed status.
- If two users edit the same proposal simultaneously, the most recent changes are used.
- Proposals created in yield analytics are kept in the database for seven days, unless they are replaced with a matching order during nightly processing.
  - The amount of time that proposals stay in the system can be configured. For details, see your Client Services Manager.
- The column headers in the template are there for ease of completion, but they aren't required for the import process to work.
