# Microsoft Invest - Anonymous Reach Expansion

In the **Audience & Location Targeting** section of an ALI, enable **Anonymous Reach Expansion**. 

Enabling this toggle allows Microsoft to expand reach to users for whom we do not have identifiable information. If frequency caps are applied, modeling is used to ensure those caps are maintained.

By default this toggle is disabled, meaning the line item will not serve if the impression does not contain identifiers. In this case, frequency capping will function as usual.

> [!Note] 
> If the line item has a CPA goal or a user-based audience segment, this setting is ignored and only identified traffic is allowed.
