# Microsoft Monetize - Selling curated deals

> Deal curation is not available to all clients. Contact your Microsoft Advertising representative for information on how you can be enabled for deal curation.

buyers special access to inventory and/or data. For example, a curated
deal might provide preferential pricing on inventory, access to
exclusive inventory, audience or contextual data, or other
opportunities.

- [deal lists for curated deals](../curate//deal-lists-for-curated-deals.md) - Learn how to
