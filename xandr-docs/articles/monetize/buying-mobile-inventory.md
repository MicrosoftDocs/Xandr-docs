There are several different ways to buy mobile inventory using
Xandr. The procedures are similar, but they vary
slightly depending on how you want to buy. The documents in the
Campaign Setup section show you how to
set up your campaigns for each of these scenarios.

The documents in the Working with Mobile
Advertisers section give you the information you need in order to
work with mobile advertisers. It covers topics from running cost per
install offers (also known as cost per download) to managing
discrepancies. The "Related Topics" section below lists other
documentation available in this section.
