# Microsoft Curate - Video targeting

You can target video inventory based on the playback method, player
size, and position.

In the **Viewability & Environment
Targeting** section of a line item, click the pencil icon next to
**Video Player**.

You can target video creatives in any or all of the following ways:

- [Target video inventory by position](#target-video-inventory-by-position-or-context)
- [Target video inventory by playback method](#target-video-inventory-by-playback-method)
- [Target video by player width](#target-video-inventory-by-player-width)

> [!NOTE]
> You should avoid using both VAST creatives and in-banner or interstitial video creatives within the same video campaign. An in-banner or interstitial video creative will not serve when you target by position. Setting any of the three video targeting parameters (i.e., **Playback Method**, **Player Size**, or **Position**) will restrict inventory to only those that satisfy the specified parameters and thus significantly limit your delivery potential. By default, you will target all playback methods, player sizes and roll positions. However, you can narrow your targeting.

## Target video inventory by position or context

The options available to target inventory by position, also called
context:

- **Instream** - Video ads are embedded within a video player.
  - **Pre-roll** - Inventory that hosts video creatives that play before
    the user selected video of choice.
  - **Mid-roll** - Inventory that hosts video creatives that play in the
    middle of the user selected video of choice.
  - **Post-roll** - Inventory that hosts video creatives that play after
    the user selected video of choice.
  - **No roll position defined** - Target inventory where no position
    information has been provided.
- **Outstream** - Video ads are embedded within the body of a web page.

## Target video inventory by playback method

You can target inventory that accepts creatives with the following
playback methods:

- **Auto-play, sound on** - Video creative starts playing with sound on
  as soon as the page loads.
- **Auto-play, sound off** - Video creative starts playing with sound
  off as soon as the page loads. Sound comes on when the user clicks on
  the creative.
- **Auto-play, sound unknown** - Video creative starts playing as soon
  as the page loads, but no sound information is specified.
- **Click-to-play** - Video creative is static on the page till the user
  clicks to play.
- **Mouse-over** - Video starts playing when the user moves the mouse
  over the creative.
- **No playback method provided** - Target inventory where no initiation
  method information is provided (e.g., YouTube inventory).

> [!NOTE]
> - For maximum delivery and reach, we recommend that you include **No initiation method provided** in your targeting since some inventory (such as Google Ad Manager) is not classified. 
> - Playback method targeting is not available for Google Ad Manager (181).

## Target video inventory by player width

Player inventory is available across all supply types (web, mobile web,
and mobile app). The following player sizes are available to target:

- **Large -** primarily large-format web inventory (minimum width of 640
  pixels)
- **Medium -** includes most smartphone player inventory for mobile apps
  (minimum width of 320 pixels, maximum width of 639 pixels)
- **Small -** primarily in-banner inventory (maximum width of 319
  pixels)
- **No player width provided**

> [!TIP]
> For maximum delivery and reach, we recommend that you include **No player width provided** in your targeting, because some inventory (such as Google Ad Manager) is not classified.

You can either click the graphic to make a selection or check the
appropriate checkbox.
