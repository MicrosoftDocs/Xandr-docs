# Microsoft Monetize - Geography targeting

## In This Section

- [How Geography Targeting Works](how-geography-targeting-works.md) - Learn how geography targeting works.
- [Changes to Geography Objects](changes-to-geography-objects.md) - See recent changes to geolocation data.

You can target impressions based on the geographic location of the users viewing them.

In the **Targeting** section of a line item or campaign, click the **Edit** button next to **Geography**.

Follow the instructions for the relevant geographic targeting option below.

- Target users by country, region, state, or city
- Target users by metro code
- Target users by postal code
- Target users by political districts

> [!WARNING]
> **Accuracy of geo targeting**
>
> Although targeting by country is highly accurate, the more specific the targeting, the more imprecise the results. This is especially true when targeting locations as granular as cities, metro codes, and zip codes. Also, depending upon which geographic targeting options you choose, you may significantly reduce the likelihood of a match.
> [!NOTE]
> **Geo targeting & third-party buying filters**
>
> For third-party buying, geographic targeting is limited by any existing country settings in your Third-Party Buying Filters at the networkle vel. If countries are included in your Third-Party Buying Filters, only those countries and the regions and cities within them will be available for targeting.

## Target users by country, region, or city

By default, you will target users in all geographic locations. On the Country/Region/City tab, however, you can narrow your targeting to include or exclude specific countries,
regions/states, or cities.

- The **Countries** lists shows all countries that can be targeted. You can either include or exclude countries or drill into a country to see its regions/states. Note that when you exclude a country, its regions and cities are not available for further inclusion or exclusion.
- **Regions** are more granular than countries. Generally speaking, regions are based upon whatever method the country in question uses to
  divide itself into parts. For example, regions within the United States are states. Canada is divided into its provinces, and India is
  divided into its states and union territories. The **Regions** lists shows all of the regions/states that can be targeted. You can either
  include or exclude regions/states or drill into a region/state to view its cities. Note that when you exclude a region, its cities are not
  available for further inclusion or exclusion.
- The **Cities** list shows all of the cities that can be targeted. You can either include or exclude cities.

> [!TIP]
> Click the column headers to sort countries, regions, or cities by name or ID, or use the search field to find a particular location.
> [!WARNING]
> Do not add conflicting geographic targeting at multiple levels. For example, if you are including the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and then you also include US zip codes, your campaign will only serve the US zip codes targeted. In this scenario, zip code targeting will automatically limit the targeting to the US only. Similarly, do not target both the region of Arizona and the metro code of New York, because targeting is an AND relationship.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Country, region/state, and city targeting is supported by an IP lookup service provided by [Digital Envoy](https://www.digitalelement.com/). For more information, see
> [How Geography Targeting Works](how-geography-targeting-works.md).

## Target users by metro code

Metro codes are available for targeting in several countries. These include United States metro codes/MSAs, United Kingdom ITV Regions, French Departments, German Nielsen metro codes, South Korean Si/Gun/Gu, Chinese Diji Shi cities, and Russian Federal Districts, among others.

By default, you will target users in all metro codes. On the **Metro Code** tab, however, you can narrow your targeting to include or exclude specific metro codes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Metro code targeting is supported by an IP lookup service provided by [Digital Envoy](https://www.digitalelement.com/). For more information, see [How Geography Targeting Works](how-geography-targeting-works.md).

## Target users by postal code

On the **Postal Code** tab, once you select a country, you can include up to 4000 postal codes using a comma-separated or line-separated list. Postal codes can be alphanumeric
strings of up to 14 characters and can contain a space or hyphen. Postal codes may only be included (not excluded).

> [!NOTE]
> Certain legitimate ZIP or postal codes are unrecognizable or invalid within the Xandr geography targeting system. This can happen because [Digital Envoy](https://www.digitalelement.com/), a Xandr partner that handles geolocation data, can't recognize a ZIP or postal code's existence until an IP address (user) has been associated with it.
> Postal codes that don't exist in the system often represent obscure or otherwise small geographical zones with minimal internet activity.

Unlike other types of geographic targeting, postal code targeting is include only.

As a guide to how postal codes should be formatted for each country, consult the list below:

- Australia - 7470
- Austria - 9992
- Brazil - 99990-000
- Canada - Y1A 6T5
- China - 860700
- Czech Republic - 798 62
- Finland - 99999
- France - 95880
- Germany - 99998
- Hungary - 9985
- India - 855107
- Italy - 98168
- Japan - 999-8317
- Mexico - 99994
- Netherlands - 9999 XA
- Norway - 99990-000
- Poland - 99-440
- Portugal - 9980-032
- Romania - 927250
- Russian Federation - 694923
- Spain - 52080
- Sweden - 984 94
- Switzerland - 9658
- United Kingdom - ZE3 9
- United States - 99950

If your list contains postal codes that do not exist in our database, you will be presented with an error message and given the chance to correct and resubmit any invalid postal codes. Some common formatting errors that may generate an error message are:

- **Excel-Truncated Zeros:** Excel may truncate leading zeros from postal codes if they are numeric (e.g., 06514 becomes 6514). However, an alphanumeric postal code such as "0AH 135" would not be affected.
- **Country:** Postal codes can only be added for one country at a time.
- **US zip codes:** Only 5-digit zip codes are accepted.
Ranges are no longer supported. You will need to add each individual postal code to the list.

## Target users by political districts


Political Geography Targeting allows political buyers to target geographies based on legislative district boundaries. The feature is available within the existing geo targeting module in Invest, and it's called "Political District (US Only)". The Political District Targeting allows buyers to target the following political geography levels:

- Congressional District
- State Senate District
- State House District
