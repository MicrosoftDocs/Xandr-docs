# Reconciling your Seller Statement with Reporting





## Run the Seller Billing Report

In the UI, run the Selling Billing Report to view your Seller Revenue on
your seller activity statement. You can also use the Selling Billing
Report to confirm your (Managed) Ad Serving fee on your invoice.



1.  On the Member reporting screen, select
    Selling Billing Report in the
    Type dropdown.
2.  Enter a date in the Range field
    that corresponds to the period start and end date on your invoice,
    and then click Run report.







## Confirm Invoice Values (Selling)

The (Managed) Ad Serving Fee is the amount to be paid to
Xandr for kept, blank, default, and PSA
impressions (which includes filtered requests). The sum of the
Total Imps\* in the
Blank,
Default,
Kept, and
PSA rows should match the value in the
**Billable Units** column on your invoice. To calculate the charge,
multiply the sum of Total Imps\* where **Impression Type** is **Blank**,
**Default**, **Kept**, or **PSA** by the CPM ad serving fee in your
Xandr contract. The value you have calculated
should match the value in the **Amount** column on your invoice.

\*Total Imps = Imps + Filtered Requests
