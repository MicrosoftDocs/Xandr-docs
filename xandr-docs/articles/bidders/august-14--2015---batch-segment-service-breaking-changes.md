# August 14, 2015 - Batch Segment Service Breaking Changes



We are making several breaking changes to the <a
href="https://docs.xandr.com/bundle/xandr-bidders/page/batch-segment-service.html"
class="xref" target="_blank">Batch Segment Service</a>.

These changes will take place 60 days from today, on **October 7th,
2015**.

Specifically, we are:

- Reducing the number of objects we return when you ask for your file
  upload history (via the `batch_segment_upload_job` field) to the last
  30 daysâ€™ worth.
- Changing the API response to return secure (SSL-encrypted) upload URLs
  via the `upload_url` field.
- Limiting file upload sizes to 0.5 GB.

For more information about what constitutes a breaking change, please
see our <a
href="https://docs.xandr.com/bundle/xandr-bidders/page/breaking-changes.html"
class="xref" target="_blank">Breaking Changes Policy</a>. If you have
any questions about this change, please reach out to your
AppNexus representative.
