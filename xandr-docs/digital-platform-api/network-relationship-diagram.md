# Network relationship diagram

Below is a diagram outlining the relationships between some of the core API services for Ad Networks. You'll note that this mimics the User Interface setup with the exception of the profile object. On the back end, campaigns are created through a combination of a profile object, which includes targeting information, and a campaign object, which includes start and end dates, budget, and associated creatives.
