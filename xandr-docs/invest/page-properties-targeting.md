# Microsoft Invest - Page properties targeting

Page properties targeting allows you to target impressions based on the creative tag's position on the page or by using values passed through the query string in the ad call.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - To enable or disable page property targeting for your seat, submit a Product Support ticket.
> - As sellers provide tag position and query strings, these targeting options are typically utilized when buying direct inventory.

1. In the **Targeting** section of your line item, click the pencil icon in the **Page Properties** row.
    1. The **Page Properties Targeting** dialog displays.
1. Select checkboxes for the specific creative tag positions that you wish target (all tag positions are targeted by default):
    - **Above the Fold** - The top half of the page.
    - **Below the Fold** - The bottom half of the page.
    - **Unknown** - Undetermined location on the page.
1. Click the toggle to enable query-string targeting (all query strings are targeted by default).
    1. Choose to **Include** or **Exclude** either **all** or **any** of the query strings you wish to declare.
    1. Enter a valid query string into the text box.
    1. Click **+Add Another String** to add additional query strings. Repeat this step as many times as necessary.
1. Click **Save**.
