You create augmented line items (ALIs) to define your financial
relationship with an advertiser, set up targeting for an advertising
campaign, and schedule your advertisements to run.

Before you begin creating a line item, you must first perform the
following tasks:

- <a href="create-an-advertiser.html" class="xref">Create an
  Advertiser</a>

- <a href="create-an-insertion-order.html" class="xref">Create an
  Insertion Order</a>

  The insertion order you created must have at least one billing period
  with dates in the future.

You can create a line item before you have performed the following
tasks, but you will need to complete them before you can activate your
line item and launch your advertising campaign. If you want to create a
line item before you create these other objects, you can create them
afterwards and add them to the line item.

create a line item.
