# Solving Delivery Issues with Order Line Visibility



In addition to being a dashboard for a given order line, you can use
the Order Line Visibility page as a tool for troubleshooting order line
delivery.


## Solving Delivery Issues by Analyzing Competition

The top of the Order Line Visibility page diplays basic information
about the selected order line. Click the Show Details link to view
additional information. 

The Trafficked As field shows the name
of the underlying attribute to which the order line is currently
targeted. If the order line has gone through targeting changes, expand
the list of Historical Targeting to show a list of targets as well as
the time period for which they were associated with the order line. 

The Performance Details section is a
good way to understand the delivery pattern of the order line over time.

You can adjust the Time Period to view future delivery, historical
delivery, or both. The chart in this section is grouped by day by
default. This can help identify uneven delivery or periods when major
under-delivery might occur. Click Show
Performance Data to view a table of statistical details for the
order line over its lifetime and the specified date range. 

Examine the Competition tab for order
lines that can be adjusted. This is to help the focus order line deliver
on pace.

The Competition tab contains other
order lines that are likely to affect the focus order line. This is due
to their overlapping inventory requirements. You can mouse over each
name in the Order Line column to
display information for that order line.
