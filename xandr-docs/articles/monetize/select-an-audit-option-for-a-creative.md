# Select an Audit Option for a Creative



When adding creatives, you can specify if you want to audit your own
creatives or have Xandr audit them. An unaudited
creative can only run on your managed publishers. Unaudited creatives
aren't eligible to run on third-party inventory unless the seller
specifically allows it.



<div class="li step p">

Select one of the following audit options from the
Creative Quality section:



- Platform Audit: Select this option
  to submit the creative for auditing by the
  Xandr Audit team and perform the following:
  - Select a priority.

    <div id="audit-a-creative__note_a2p_bxp_xxb"
    

    Note: Business days are from 9:00pm
    Sunday to 11:59pm Friday ET.

    

    Xandr charges a fee for each audited creative. Creatives are audited
    in the order that they are received with a target completion time of
    one business day from the submission time. Priority audits, which
    are available for an additional fee, are completed within two
    business hours. The **priority table** below lists the fee charged
    for audits conducted for different time durations.

  - Enter a desktop compatible URL in the
    Brand URL text field.
    <div id="audit-a-creative__note_b2p_bxp_xxb"
    

    Note: The
    Brand URL should contain the same
    branding that is represented on your CTV, OTT, or mobile creative.
    The Audit team will use the URL to validate the branding represented
    on the creative.

    

  - Select the language that is used
    in the creative such as French, German, or Chinese.
    <div id="audit-a-creative__note_g3h_x3p_byb"
    

    Note: Modifying the selected
    language will cause the creative
    to be resubmitted for audit.

- Self Audit: Select this option to
  classify the creative on your own. For further guidance on
  self-auditing, see <a href="self-auditing-creatives.html" class="xref"
  title="When adding creatives to Xandr, it&#39;s to your advantage to submit each creative to Xandr for human auditing. The manual audit process includes checking technical attributes, sensitive categories, offer category, brand, and language to enable seller protection features on the platform.">Self-Auditing
  Creatives</a>.

  <div id="audit-a-creative__note_xwl_slp_byb"
  

  Note: Self-auditing may reduce access
  to inventory outside of your network since many sellers only allow
  Xandr audited creatives.

  

  Set any one of the following creative attributes:

  - Brand: This lets other sellers on
    the platform know what brands this creative is associated with in
    the system.
  - Offer Categories: This lets
    sellers know the offer category such as Education or Employment.
  - Language: The language used in the
    creative such as French, German, or Chinese.
  - Technical Attributes: It describes
    the features associated with the creative, such as whether it is a
    video.
  - Sensitive Attributes: These are
    often banned by publishers.



<div id="audit-a-creative__note_eb4_nmp_byb"


Note: The Compliance must be confirmed
for self audited creatives.





- No Audit: Select this option if you
  do not want the creative to be audited.
  <div id="audit-a-creative__note_h1x_34p_byb"
  

  Note: When selecting
  No Audit, this may result in the
  creative serving less frequently, as publishers might choose to block
  it.
