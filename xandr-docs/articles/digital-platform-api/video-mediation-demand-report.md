# Video Mediation Demand report

The **Video Mediation Demand Report** can be used by video mediation clients to evaluate performance of mediated networks and optimize
waterfall priorities. The report incorporates mediation and financial data as well as data on individual partner waterfall performance that will be made available through updates to the video mediation framework.

For instructions on retrieving a report, see [Report Service](report-service.md) or the [examples](#examples) below.

## Time frame

The `report_interval` field in the JSON request can be set to one of the following:

- custom
- today
- last_24_hours
- yesterday
- last_48_hours

## Examples

### Create JSON formatted report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` `"video_mediation_demand_analytics"`, as well as the `columns` (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filters for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the format in which the data should be returned (`csv`, `excel`, or `html`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](report-service.md).

```
$ cat buyer_bid_error

{
    "report":
    {
        "report_type":"video_mediation_demand_report",
        "columns":[
            "hour",
            "media_type",
            "buyer_member",
            "imps"
        ],
        "report_interval":"last_48_hours",
        "format":"csv"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the Reporting service

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @video_mediation_demand 'https://api.appnexus.com/report'
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"097f59fc3ab7d02c5d60db42081d9b69"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the Report service

Make a `GET` call with the Report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `{{execution_status}}` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=097f59fc3ab7d02c5d60db42081d9b69'
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report":{
         "name":null,
         "created_on":"2010-05-25 19:19:53",
         "json_request":"{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"video_mediation_demand\",\"columns\":[\"hour\",\"media_type\",
            \"buyer_member\",\"imps\",
            \"report_interval\":\"last_48_hours\"}}",
         "url": "report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592"
      },
      "execution_status":"ready"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the Report Download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the Report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and Report ID in the `url` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!TIP]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592' > /tmp/video_mediation_demand.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
