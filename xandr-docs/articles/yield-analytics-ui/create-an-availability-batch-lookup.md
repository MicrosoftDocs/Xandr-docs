# Create an Availability Batch Lookup



You can run multiple availability lookups as part of a single
Availability report, by creating a batch lookup.

1.  Set up a new lookup for availability based on a combination of
    targeting attributes or open an existing saved lookup. Then
    click Add to
    Batch. The Availability Report panel displays the available
    inventory based on your lookup criteria, excluding CPM, impressions,
    and capacity.
2.  Modify the lookup criteria to set up a different set of targeting,
    and click Add to
    Batch. The Availability Report panel is updated with the
    available inventory based on your original lookup criteria and the
    new lookup criteria.
3.  Repeat step 2 as needed. Then click Run
    Batch.
4.  On the confirmation dialog that appears, note the batch lookup name,
    and then click OK.



<b>Tip:</b> The lookup query that you set up
on this screen will be broken out into multiple result rows that will
appear in the Availability Report panel at the bottom of the screen once
you click Add to Batch. The maximum
number of rows is capped at 10,000 by default. That figure represents a
reasonable limit, which is configurable at your request. Please contact
your Client Services Manager if you feel that a higher ceiling is
necessary.
