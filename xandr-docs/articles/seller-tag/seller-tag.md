# Seller Tag

Xandr's seller tag (AST) is a lightweight
JavaScript SDK that runs in the header or body of a web page in a user's
browser and allows publishers to conduct auctions directly from the
page. AST consolidates all ad slots on a page to be auctioned and sends
information about them in a single ad request whenever possible. AST
loads asynchronously, meaning that ad calls do not block the page
content from loading.

The following pages provide an overview of AST, how to implement it, an
API reference and using AST in specific situations.

> [!NOTE]
> - AST will work with AMP HTML markup. The library currently only supports banner ads. Click here for detailed information: [https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/main/ads/appnexus.md](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/main/ads/vendors/appnexus.md)
> - AST uses the "count on begin to render" methodology to track impressions.
