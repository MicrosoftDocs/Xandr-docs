    click Analyzed Network.
2.  In the Parent Product Filter dialog that appears, select the parent
    product for the order, or type in the box to find a specific
    product.
3.  Click Update.

To reset the Orders Dashboard to your entire analyzed network,
enter Analyzed Network in the Parent Product Filter dialog.
