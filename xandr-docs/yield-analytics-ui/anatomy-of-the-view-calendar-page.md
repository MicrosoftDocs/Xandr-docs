# Anatomy of View Calendar page

The View Calendar page on the Availability tab shows a daily summary of future availability by month.

## View Calendar page

The View Calendar page can be displayed in two views:

- Calendar view – This is the default view for the page and shows a high-level graphical representation of the availability for a given month. You can mouse over each day to see a breakdown of capacity, availability, and sell-through information, as well as the number of booked, pending, and proposed order lines.

- List view – This drill-down view shows each day in the month as a row in a table. You can expand and collapse rows as needed to see full details on the order lines scheduled for that day.

To the left of the daily summary is the Filter panel, where you define how you want availability to be displayed and based on what criteria.

Above the daily summary is a toolbar, where you can switch between views and select the month for which you want to see availability. You can also export the data from the daily summary to an Excel spreadsheet (XLS) or comma-separated values (CSV) file.

## Calendar view details

The values in each date represent the following:

x% or y = (For example, 100% or 15,000,000) Percentage of impressions available or number of impressions available, depending on how you're showing availability
 = Number of booked order lines
 = Number of pending order lines = Number of proposed order lines

The colors in each date represent the following based on your selections in the Color slider in the Filter panel:

 = Date is available for booking  
 = Date has some inventory available for booking but should be booked with caution.  
 = Date is unavailable for booking

## List view details

The colors in each row represent the following based on your selections in the Color slider in the Filter panel:

 = Date is available for booking
 = Date has some inventory available for booking but should be booked with caution.
 = Date is unavailable for booking
