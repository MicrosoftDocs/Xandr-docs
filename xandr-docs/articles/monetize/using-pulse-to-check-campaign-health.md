# Using Pulse to Check Campaign Health



Pulse is a feature on the
<a href="explore-campaigns.html" class="xref"><span
class="ph uicontrol">Campaigns</a> screen that provides a
visualization of campaign spending in real time. This feature allows you
to quickly screen for delivery issues in your live campaigns.



Tip: **Pulse Keeps Campaigns Healthy**

You can use Pulse to:

- Confirm campaigns are live minutes after they start spending
- Diagnose delivery issues quickly with a shorter feedback loop
- Confidently optimize by seeing changes take effect soon after you make
  them



Viewing Pulse Data

It's easy to display Pulse metrics for your campaigns. From the
Campaigns screen, click the
Pulse button.

This reveals three columns - one containing sparklines, one containing
spend in the last 60 seconds, and one containing impressions - that show
how your campaigns are spending.

Understanding Pulse Data

The sparklines show how each campaign has been spending minute-by-minute
for the last 30 minutes. The orange dots on the sparkline indicate the
high and low points of spending in the last 30 minutes, as well as the
current spend.

You can also click on a sparkline to see it enlarged in a separate
dialog.

Troubleshooting with Pulse

When Pulse is activated for your campaigns, you can easily see if a
campaign has stopped spending. A flat line is an indication that your
campaign has run into delivery issues.

If you see a flat sparkline for any of your campaigns, you can click the
edit icon in-line for that campaign to change
<a href="update-campaigns.html" class="xref">Update Campaigns</a>, or
click the graph icon to view
<a href="view-campaign-details.html" class="xref">View Campaign
Details</a> and assess for trouble spots.

When you make adjustments, they take effect in about 10 minutes - this
is the time it takes for them to propagate to the ad server. Once your
changes are in effect, you can see whether they improved campaign
delivery right away.

With Pulse, you can see and address campaign delivery issues promptly,
helping to ensure that your campaigns are spending effectively
throughout their lifespans.
