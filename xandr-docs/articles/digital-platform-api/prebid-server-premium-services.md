# Prebid Server Premium services

Xandr's Prebid Server Premium (PSP) is a self-service, server-side solution offering control over unified auctions that maximizes revenue
for publishers' inventory. As part of Microsoft Monetize, users can manage settings, optimize partners, and review analytics within the Microsoft Monetize UI or via our APIs. PSP is supported across channels (web, mobile web, mobile app, over-the-top) and formats (display, native, video).

The following API services are available:

- [Prebid Server Premium Config Services](prebid-server-premium-config-services.md)
- [Long Form Video Service](long-form-video-service.md)
- [Report Service](report-service.md)

To leverage the PSP UI instead of APIs, review the documentation below:

- [Add or Edit PSP Global Settings](../monetize/add-or-edit-psp-global-settings.md)
- [Add or Edit a Demand Partner](../monetize/add-or-edit-a-demand-partner.md)
- [Add, Edit, or Delete a PSP Configuration](../monetize/add-edit-or-delete-a-psp-configuration.md)

> [!NOTE]
> At this time, not all clients have access to PSP. If you would like more information, contact your Xandr Representative.
