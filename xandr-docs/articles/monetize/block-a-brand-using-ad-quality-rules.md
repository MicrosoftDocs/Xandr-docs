# Block a Brand Using Ad Quality Rules



You can use Network and Publisher Ad Quality to
block a brand from serving creatives on placements for an entire
network, a single publisher, or only specific placements.



First, identify the brand(s) you wish to block. If it's unclear what
brand a served creative belongs to, run a
<a href="seller-brand-review-report.md" class="xref">Seller Brand
Review Report</a> and filter by publishers and time ranges to find the
creative's ID and its corresponding brand name and brand ID. For more
information, see <a
href="seller-brand-review-report.md#ID-00005460__ol-700fd5fa-727a-4cfb-9105-679c4e0a40cb"
class="xref">How to Run a Seller Brand Review Report</a>.





You may want to prevent certain brands from serving on your ad
placements, whether for an entire network, certain publishers, or even a
single placement. For example, it's common to block a competitive
brand's ads from serving. You may also wish to block a particular brand
because it doesn't match your network or publisher's requirements.





1.  Decide whether to block brands for a member,
    publisher, or certain ad placements:
