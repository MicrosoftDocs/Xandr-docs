## Benefits

Curators such as retailers, data companies, independent trading desks,
and other media companies can use audience data, preferred inventory
access, specially negotiated rates with sellers, optimization
capabilities, investment strategy, and other assets to provide curated
deals to buyers.

For buyers who execute a large volume of campaigns and need to manage
their media investment, Xandr Curate offers a
single platform to easily centralize their business rules and targeting
configurations across DSPs to simplify campaign execution.
Using Xandr Curate, buyers can act as curators
to create deals that reflect their decisions about segments, supply
types, inventory lists, margin percentage, optimization, and so on.

Curated deals can be bought via Xandr's
Invest DSP and all major DSPs.
