# Edit a user group

If you have administrative permissions, you can edit user groups to add and remove users in the group. You can also change the permissions for the group.

1. On the **Admin Tools** menu, click **Permissions**. The Permissions page appears, displaying the Groups panel with a table of all existing user groups.
1. Click the user group you want to edit. The Group: \[Group Name\] panel appears. \[Group Name\] is the name of the group you selected.
1. Update the name and/or description of the group in the **Group Summary** section as needed.
1. Add and remove users in the **Users in This Group** section as follows:
    - To add users to the group, in the list of usernames on the left, select each username you want to add (or click **Select All** to add all users). As you select users, they are highlighted in the list on the left, and added to the list on the right.
    - To remove users from the group, in the list of usernames on the right, click the X for each username you want to remove (or click **Clear All** to remove all users). As you select to remove users, they are deleted from the list on the right and un-highlighted in the list on the left.
1. Change the permissions for the group as needed in the **Features Available In This Group** section. Select the check boxes for the features the group should be able to access. Clear the check boxes for the features the group shouldn't be able to access. The features are broken up into the following sets:
Capacity, Availability, Products, Orders, Proposals, Pricing, Reports, Scenario, Admin Tools, and Other.
1. Click **Save**.
