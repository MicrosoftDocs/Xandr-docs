# Microsoft Monetize - Augmented line items (ALI)

## Overview

The purpose of the Augmented Line Item (ALI) is to streamline a trader's
workflow on the Microsoft Advertising platform. It does this by
enhancing already familiar features while providing new options and
settings to support more sophisticated users. In addition, the ALI
performs various functions in an automated fashion that previously had
required tedious manual adjustment and maintenance by traders. As a
result, ALI allows traders to rapidly create buying strategies on the
platform, provides tools that specifically address trader goals while
reducing daily management and overhead.

## Advantages of ALI

When using ALI, you have access to a suite of powerful algorithms and
tools that help you save time and achieve improved performance against
your client's goals. ALI delivers the following benefits to traders:

- Efficient workflows and algorithms.
- Powerful optimization.
- Optimal utilization of budget while reaching an optimized state.
- Access to the streamlined Programmable Splits interface which allows
  you to leverage the power of [custom models](../data-science-toolkit/custom-models.md) (formerly
  AppNexus Programmable Bidder) and execute
  highly-customized trading strategies. This enables you to achieve your
  client's goals without needing to write code.
