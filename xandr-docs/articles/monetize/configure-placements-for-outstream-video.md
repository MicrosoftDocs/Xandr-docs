# Configure Placements for Outstream Video





In order to set up your outstream inventory, you must configure a
placement with the following settings:

- **Media Types**: Click Other and
  select the Video media type which
  will automatically include the **Standard VAST** media subtype.
- **Size**: Should be set to 1x1 (the video player size is declared on
  the Video Settings tab).



If you have
<a href="outstream-video-player-options.md" class="xref">outstream
video player options</a>, you may fine-tune your outstream video player
options to enable waterfall processing and further increase your ability
to find viable ads within your specified timeout period.



A new Video Settings tab appears when
the **Video** media type is selected. On the
Video Settings tab, you must configure
the following:

- **Position** (also known as context): Select
  outstream.
- **Duration**: Enter maximum duration of returned content you will
  accept (in seconds).
- **Skippable**: Whether the player shows a button to skip the ad.
  Clicking the button closes the outstream ad unit.
- **Playback Method**: How the video is initiated and audio options.
- **Player Width**: The default width of the player that will be
  rendered on the page.
- **Media Types**: Click Other and
  select the Video media type which
  will automatically include the **Standard VAST** media subtype.
- **Size**: Should be set to 1x1 (the video player size is declared on
  the Video Settings tab).
- **Vast Version**: Select the video player's VAST version from the
  Player Vast Version menu. The
  default value is VAST 2.0. You should use the most recent VAST version
  that your player can handle because players are backwards compatible.
  Therefore, creatives with lower VAST versions can still serve on these
  placements. For example, a VAST 2.0 creative can serve on a VAST 4.0
  player, but a VAST 4.0 creative can't serve on a VAST 2.0 player. The
  following VAST versions are supported:
  - VAST 2.0
  - VAST 3.0
  - VAST 4.0
  - VAST 4.1
  - VAST 4.2
