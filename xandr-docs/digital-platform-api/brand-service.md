# Digital Platform API - Brand service

The read-only Brand Service allows you to see what advertiser brands are registered in ourÂ system, the urls associated to each brand, the number of active creatives assigned to each brand, and more. You can also use the Brand Service to obtain the ID assigned to a specific brand. This ID is used in the [Ad Profile Service](ad-profile-service.md) and as an optional input for the [Creative Service](creative-service.md).

Brands are categorized by company and category. See the [Brand Company Service](brand-company-service.md) and [Category Service](category-service.md) for more information.

## REST API

| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `https://api.appnexus.com/brand` | View all brands <br><br> **Note**: It can take a while to receive all brands because, by default, the response tells you the number of active creatives assigned to each brand. To remove `num_creatives` from the response, and speed up the call significantly, you can pass `simple=true` in the query string, i.e., `https://api.appnexus.com/brand?simple=true`. |
| `GET` | `https://api.appnexus.com/brand?search=BRAND_NAME` | View all brands with names containing certain characters |
| `GET` | `https://api.appnexus.com/brand?url_search=BRAND_URL` | View all brands with URLs containing complete words |
| `GET` | `https://api.appnexus.com/brand?id=BRAND_ID` | View a particular brand |

## JSON fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `category_id` | int | The ID of the category associated with the brand. |
| `company_id` | int | The ID of the company associated with the brand. |
| `id` | int | The ID of the brand. |
| `is_premium` | boolean | If `true`, the brand is a premium brand. |
| `last_modified` | string | When the brand was last modified. |
| `name` | string | The name of the brand. |
| `num_creatives` | int | Deprecated. Currently returns 0. |
| `parent_brand_id` | int | The `parent_brand_id` is the ID of the company that owns the child brand. <br> **Default**: null <br><br> **Note**: The "default_brand_status" setting in [Ad quality rules](ad-profile-service.md) will be overridden when a seller sets an explicit trust setting for a brand's parent brand. Xandr groups brands entities into parent/child relationships. <br> If a seller blocks or approves a parent brand, all child brands without an explicit approval or block setting, will inherit the seller's ad quality settings for that brand's parent brand. <br> Reach out to Xandr Account Representative if bid error reports include brands you believe are not blocked by your ad quality settings.  |
| `urls` | array of strings | URLs associated with the brand. The format is [`"brandurl.com"`, `"brandurl.net"`, ...] |
