# Floor Optimization



You can enable floor optimization for any floor rule. When enabled,
floor optimization adjusts the hard floor for every impression to better
protect and value a seller's inventory.



Note: Floor Optimization is currently
in a closed Beta. We are working to roll this feature out to more
clients. This feature was built to support second-price auctions, and
may not perform as expected in other auctions.

## What is Floor Optimization?

Floor optimization works to maximize seller revenue by calculating a
hard floor based on an individual impression's value to the seller.
Floor optimization incorporates characteristics, such as inventory,
geography, and other factors, and quickly adjusts to changes in
marketplace liquidity. Optimal floors are set before bids are received.

Regardless of whether or not floor optimization is enabled, bids are
never reduced below a hard floor. If floor optimization is turned on for
a floor rule, soft floors are not available. For more information about
soft floors, see
<a href="understanding-yield-management.html" class="xref">Understanding
Yield Management</a>.
