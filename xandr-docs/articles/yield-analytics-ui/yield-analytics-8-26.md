# Yield Analytics 8.26



Order Line Visibility: The Yield Analytics 8.26 release includes several
user-interface updates designed to increase performance of the Order
Line Visibility Page.

The Order Line Visibility page layout contains the same data as before,
but is now organized in a tabular format.  The default view
provides Performance data for the order line using the configured date
range, while the Competition, Consumption, History,
and Recommendations information is now available through additional
links in the data pane navigation menu (highlighted red in below
screenshot). The configuration settings (highlighted orange in below
screenshot) for each data view are now displayed within the data pane in
the top left-hand corner.  Configuration settings allow you to change
data groupings, metrics, and filtering within the different
informational screens.
