# Working With Scenarios Overview



Use Scenario Manager to run simulations of how modifications to an order
line would affect its delivery, as well as the delivery of any competing
and overlapping order lines.

Scenario Manager is most commonly used to troubleshoot order line
delivery. Ad operations traffickers and account managers use it to solve
order line pacing issues. Sales planners use it to analyze a proposal
before it is sent to a potential client.

Scenario Manager doesn't have its own tab, but you can access it at any
time from the Scenario link.
