# Exchanges and Members





## Workflow

Clicking the Exchanges and
Members tab accesses a screen where you can select which
exchanges and members you want. You can
either **include **or exclude the
desired exchanges by clicking either the **green checkmark icon**
(include), or the **red minus sign icon** (exclude).



<b>Note:</b> For some exchanges, it is allowed
to also include/exclude specific members. Other exchanges do not have
this option. In this case, the include/exclude options will be disabled.

Click on the **arrow** to the right of the **Name** entry to access a
list of members in that exchange. You can then select the members you
want.

When you close the Exchanges and
Members tab, a summary is shown in the upper right-hand corner of
the Exchanges and Members display
bar that shows that you've applied some sort of targeting.





## About Exchanges

Exchanges are groups of sellers (members) organized to allow for easier
supply targeting.

- Targeting an exchange will include or exclude traffic from all of its
  members. You can combine exchange targeting with domain list targeting
  and/or member targeting.
- As new sellers are added, you do not have to update your profile or
  targeting. When targeting a single exchange, you will receive all
  members within it and any new members that join. 
- The Microsoft Monetize supply exchange includes
  inventory that represents the most direct path to supply. This
  inventory is brought to you directly through the
  Xandr SSP technology.  
  - You can find out more information
    about Microsoft Monetize supply here: <a

    Supply for External Demand Partners</a>
- Sellers that belong to the Microsoft Monetize
  supply exchange can not be individually included and excluded.
