# Microsoft Curate - Partnership details screen - Seller view

On the Partnership details screen you can review and manage your relationship with a specific buyer. You can track overall revenue trends, view the buyer's top brands on your inventory, view your top publishers for the buyer, view the privileges you have granted for the buyer, view active and upcoming deals, and create new deals for buyers.

## Getting to the partnership details screen

**Publisher clients**: Select **Marketplace > Partner Center All other clients**: Select **Partners** >  **Partner Center**.

Then click on a buyer.

## Viewing buyer contact info and description

View information the buyer has provided, including the main contact's name, phone number, and email address, and a description of their business. You can contact the buyer directly in Curate by sending a message within the Activity Stream. For more information about the Activity Stream, see [Communicating with the Buyer](partnership-details-screen-seller-view.md#communicating-with-the-buyer).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the buyer has not entered their contact's name, phone number, email address, or a description of their business, then this information will not be available.

## Viewing buyer performance on your inventory

View statistics in the **Dashboard** to see how the buyer is performing on your inventory. These statistics are updated every 24 hours. The graph and two tables may update at separate times, therefore text at the top of each section notes when the last update occurred.

> [!NOTE]
> If the buyer has not purchased any inventory from you, there will be no information to appear in the
> chart and tables on the **Dashboard**.

## Revenue from buyer

A graph displays revenue from all transactions between you and the buyer within the last 90 days. You can use this graph to monitor the buyer's activity on your inventory. If the buyer is targeting an active deal, this graph can help give you insight into the deal's effectiveness. Since the revenue displayed here reflects all transactions, this graph will not help you keep track of the revenue from a specific deal.

There is a data point for every day. Hover over a data point to see the date it represents, along with the amount of revenue and impressions for that day.

## Revenue by top brands

A table lists the buyer's top brands that have purchased your inventory, listed in order from most to least revenue. This information tells you which of the buyer's brands are performing best on your inventory.

## Revenue by top publishers

A table lists your top publishers that the buyer has purchased inventory from, listed in order from most to least revenue. This information tells you which of your publishers are performing best with the buyer.

### Communicating with the buyer

In the **Activity Stream**, the **Messages** tab shows messages between you and the buyer along with the number of days since the message was posted. You can use the **Activity Stream** to introduce yourself to a new buyer, offer targeting access in exchange for increased spend, check in with the buyer to see how their targeting access is working for them, or request changes to your eligibility and inventory trust.

In this section you can:

- **Send a message:** Send the buyer a message by typing into the field at the top of the section, and then clicking
  Post. When you post a new message, the system sends a notification to the contact in the buyer's profile.
