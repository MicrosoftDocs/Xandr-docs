# Partner Center screen - Buyer view

On the **Partner Center** screen you can view your preferred partners, search all sellers, and review impression and click statistics for each seller.

## Getting to the Partner Center screen

Go to **Partners** \>  **Partner Center** to reach the **Partner Center** screen.

## Switching to seller mode

If you are a network that also represents sellers, the **Buyers** and **Sellers** tabs display. Click **Sellers** to view the **Partner Center** as a buyer looking for sellers.

## Managing your profile

Click the **My Profile** button to edit the information that sellers will see on your **Partner Details** page. Your profile provides information about your company which helps sellers understand how you could be useful as a partner.

## Setting seller defaults

> [!NOTE]
> Inventory trust settings only apply to standard line item targeting.

You can establish inventory trust settings for all sellers. Click **Default Settings** to open the **Default Settings** dialog (see [Set Seller Defaults](set-seller-defaults.md)
for step-by-step instructions). You can also override these settings for individual sellers (see [Edit Seller Defaults](edit-seller-defaults.md) for details).

## Setting default inventory trust

You can define which portion of an eligible seller's inventory you trust. There are three trust levels (they are listed here from least trusted to most trusted):

- **Platform-reviewed**: Indicates that you trust only the inventory that has been audited by the Xandr platform. The Xandr domain-level platform-review consists of
  categories, sensitive attributes, and intended audience. This is the lowest level of trust and offers the fewest options (domains) in which to serve impressions, but provides the highest level of assurance that ads will not be served on questionable sites.
- **Seller-reviewed**: This indicates that, in addition to all platform-reviewed inventory (above), you also trust inventory audited by the seller. This expands the number of
  domains on which an ad can serve, but requires confidence in the review process and standards of the seller.
- **All**: This indicates that you are comfortable serving ads on any domain sent to you by this supply partner. This allows access to all domains, but expands the possibility that an ad will be served on a questionable or inappropriate site. This setting should only be used for partners with a long history of exemplary activity.

## Viewing sellers

The **Sellers** tab lists all sellers, both Monetize members and external suppliers. Their member name and ID will display along with statistics for each seller. The **Platform-wide
Avails.** columns will display statistics on all of the seller's transactions across the platform. The **Transactions with Seller** columns will display statistics on your transactions with the seller. See [Searching for Sellers](partner-center-screen-buyer-view.md#searching-for-sellers) to find a specific type of seller and then review the statistics to determine if you'd like to partner with the seller.

## Platform-wide avails

- **Avg. Daily Imps** - The average of the number of impressions the seller has sold across the entire platform for the past 7 days.
- **Avg. Daily Uniques** - The average of the number of impressions shown to unique user IDs that the seller has sold across the entire platform for the past 7 days.

## Transactions with seller

- **Imps** - The number of impressions that you have purchased from the seller.
- **Media Costs** - The cost of all of the impressions that you have purchased from the seller.
- **Clicks** - The number of clicks that were generated from inventory that you purchased from the seller.
- **CTR** - Your click-through rate on the seller's inventory. For more information on click-through rates see the [Glossary](../industry-reference/online-advertising-and-ad-tech-glossary.md).
- **Convs** - The number of conversions that were attributed to inventory that you purchased from the seller.
- **Revenue** - The amount of revenue that the seller earned from you.
- **Profit** - The amount of profit that the seller earned from you, calculated by subtracting media cost from revenue.

list of sellers by:
