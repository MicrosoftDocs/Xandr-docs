## Xandr Email Communications

Xandr periodically send emails that we think
you'll find useful. These can include Marketing Communications (event
invitations, white papers), Product and Technical Communications
(release notes, service updates), and Training Communications (webinars,
live training sessions).

- If you have a Xandr user account, you should
  receive these communications automatically.
- If you do not have your own Xandr user
  account, you can <a

  class="xref" target="_blank">sign up</a> to receive these
  communications.
- If you want to stop receiving Marketing or other
  Xandr communications, you can update your
  preferences.
