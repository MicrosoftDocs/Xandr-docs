# Request Ads Over HTTPS on iOS





<b>Note:</b> This property is deprecated.



  
Starting with iOS v2.13 and Android v2.15 of our SDKs, we support
requesting ads over HTTPS.



<b>Note:</b> This is a global setting for the
AppNexus SDK. You only need to set this once,
and all future ad requests will be sent over HTTPS.
