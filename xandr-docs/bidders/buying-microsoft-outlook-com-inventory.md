# Bidders - Buy Microsoft Outlook.com inventory

You can buy Microsoft Outlook.com inventory on the Xandr platform.

## Inventory overview

Outlook.com combines the best of Outlook and Hotmail to offer a clutter-free environment for communicating with family, friends, and colleagues. Outlook.com focuses on four key points for advertisers:

1. **Consumer Focus**: Designed with both the consumers and advertisers in mind.
1. **Advertiser Exclusivity**: There's only one advertiser per page (allowlist helps to ensure exclusivity).
1. **High Relevance**: Active(100% logged in) users provide a large pool of targeting options, which helps increase ROI.
1. **Simple, yet visual**: Simple creatives deliver imagery that stands out against a clean environment.

Outlook.com ad experiences are designed with both advertisers and consumers in mind. Located on the right side of users' email, the Skyscraper unit is fully integrated into the user experience.
