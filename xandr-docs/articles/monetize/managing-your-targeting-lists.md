# Managing Your Targeting Lists





<b>Note:</b> Targeting lists are only
available to Standard Line Items. For an overview of which targeting
options are available to Standard versus Augmented Line items, see
<a href="buy-side-targeting.md" class="xref">Buy-Side Targeting</a>.



The Targeting Lists Screen allows
you to create domain lists or app lists. These are used to target
websites by domain or mobile apps, respectively. You can use these lists
to quickly set up targeting for campaigns. You can create, view, update,
or delete lists using this screen.

For details about including or excluding targeting lists from a
campaign, see
<a href="app-targeting.md" class="xref">App Targeting</a>.

Choosing a List

1.  Select
    Network
     \>  Inventory  \>
     Targeting Lists from the
    top navigation menu.
2.  In the Targeting Lists section,
    you'll find the **Domain Lists** and App
    Lists tabs. Select either tab to display its corresponding
    lists.



<b>Note:</b> Domain targeting applies only to
**Web** and **Mobile Web** impressions and does not apply to **Mobile
App** impressions. If you have allowed your campaign to serve on mobile
apps while targeting a domain list, the campaign will be unrestricted
when buying mobile app inventory unless you have also applied
App List targeting. To avoid serving
on mobile app inventory, switch the Apps
Placements toggle in your campaign's targeting profile to
OFF.

  + New.
