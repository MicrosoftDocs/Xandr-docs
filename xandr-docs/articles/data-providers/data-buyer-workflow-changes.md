# Data Buyer Workflow Changes



To support the clearing of Data Provider costs and to represent the
distinction between Media costs and Third-party costs (e.g., for user
segments, etc.), a number of changes have been made that may affect your
workflow. These are described below.



## Adding Data Providers

To access a particular data provider's segment offering, a new workflow
is available to make that process easier.

After selecting the data providers you want access to, refresh the page
and you will see that the data provider's segments are now visible on
your account. At this point, you can now run campaigns targeting these
third-party segments.





## Campaign changes

When creating or editing campaigns, select 
Pay on a per-impression (CPM)
basis under Buying Strategy and
then select the option Bid a Media Cost CPM.

Once set, you can confirm these changes and click
Save. 

When selecting targeting options on the , if you
select the Edit button in
the Targeting section next to Segment,
the Segments dialog will display.

The available segments (along with prices, when available) will then be
displayed in the Segments dialog.

You can select the various segments that you wish to include in or
exclude from your targeting. To calculate the total costs of all
segments selected, click Calculate Data
Cost.



<b>Note:</b> For any costs for which the
yellow alert symbol is displayed, Xandr will not
clear. These alerts denote one of the following conditions:

For segments:

- you have selected a segment for which the Data Provider has not
  supplied a price
- you have selected a segment from a Data Provider who is not
  participating in Xandr automating clearing
- you have selected a user-created segment (e.g., generated via a pixel)
  not supplied by a Data Provider

For Data Cost Totals:

- one or more of the segments you selected fit the conditions listed
  above for segment alerts 







## Line Item Changes

When creating or editing line items, if you
select Cost Plus as your Tracking
Revenue Type, the Total Cost will display instead of the media cost.
