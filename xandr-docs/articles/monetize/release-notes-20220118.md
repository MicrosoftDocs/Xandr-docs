# January 18, 2022: Vendor Usage Report UI



A new report in UI, the **Vendor Usage Report**, provide details related
to the usage of data or platform powered by third party vendors (e.g.,
user segment providers), the costs of that data or feature usage, and
the line items/campaigns where vendor costs were applicable. The report
introduces two new costs as **Feature Cost** and **Segment Data Cost**.
This report is an enhanced version of the current **Data Usage Report**
(which will be deprecated on January 31, 2022).
