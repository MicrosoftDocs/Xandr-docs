# Interpreting Scenario Manager Results



When viewing the simulation results, first check the Scenario Summary
Indicators panel.

- The Revenue Impacts section displays
  the potential net gain and losses, compared to the total net gain and
  loss.
- The Change Impacts section shows how
  many order lines and products would be impacted by the overlap.

You can view the most impacted order lines (i.e., gained or lost
revenue) to see how the scenario's change would overlap with the rest of
your inventory.
