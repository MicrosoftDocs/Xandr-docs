# Bid landscape feed

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feed is not available to Microsoft Invest clients.

The Log-Level Bid Landscape Feed helps you gain insight into the demand for your inventory based on auctions involving a randomly selected set of 1% of the users on our platform. This feed contains the top fifteen bids, with one row per bid. This includes the winning bid. Please note that the winning bid may or may not have been the highest bid due to your ad quality or yield management settings.

> [!NOTE]
> Each user is randomly and evenly assigned to one of the 1000 separate user groups; once assigned to a group, a user stays in that group. This log covers auctions for users with a `user_group_id` that is less than or equal to 10. We track the timestamp and auction ID for each.

The Xandr internal name for this feed is `bid_landscape_feed`.

## Scope

Both eligible and ineligible bids from external bidders are covered by this feed, but only eligible bids from Xandr's bidder are covered. This is because bids from external bidders are checked against the seller's ad quality settings after the bids are sent, whereas bids from Xandr's bidder (`bidder_id` 2) are checked against the seller's ad quality settings before the bids are sent. Therefore, bids reported for `bidder_id` 2 will always have been eligible and will usually be shown with `bid_reject_reason` 0.

## Sequence

The columns below are listed in the same order in which they appear in the log-level feed file (top to bottom here, left to right in the file).

## Integer key

- tinyint = 1 byte (8 bit)
- smallint = 2 byte (16 bit)
- int = 4 byte (32 bit)
- bigint = 8 byte (64 bit)

## Columns

| Column Index | Column Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | date_time | UNIX Epoch time | The date and time of the bid (e.g., `1526057561` which would need to be translated to *Friday, May 11, 2018 4:52:41 PM (UTC)*). |
| 02 | auction_id_64 | bigint | The ID of the Xandr auction that included the bid. |
| 03 | user_id_64 | bigint | The ID of the user associated with the bid. |
| 04 | brand_id | int | The ID of the brand for the creative that was bid. |
| 05 | creative_id | int | The ID of the creative that was bid. |
| 06 | actual_bid_price | numeric | The actual price of the bid (in USD), net of Xandr fees.<br> For fixed price deals, this field will contain the value that was used for price ranking in the auction. Buyer bid price will be in `raw_net_bid_price`. |
| 07 | biased_bid_price | numeric | The biased price of the bid (in USD), if yield management biases were applied to the buyer. |
| 08 | bid_reject_reason | tinyint | The reason that the bid was rejected. See [Bid Reject Codes](#bid-reject-codes) below. |
| 09 | ym_floor_id | int | The ID of the yield management floor that was applied to the buyer, if any. |
| 10 | ym_bias_id | int | The ID of the yield management bias that was applied to the buyer, if any. |
| 11 | bidder_id | int | The ID of the bidder. |
| 12 | buyer_member_id | int | The ID of the buying member. |
| 13 | seller_member_id | int | The ID of the selling member. |
| 14 | total_bid_modifier | numeric | The total amount added to or deducted from the bid due to yield management biases and/or modifiers, if any. |
| 15 | exclusivity_level | tinyint | When the impbus determines the winning bid for the auction, bids with higher values get precedence over bids with lower values. Sellers can use this information to run auction simulations. Allowed values: <br> - `0` = Learn bid on a non-prefer learn impression or give up bid <br> - `1` = Non exclusive <br> - `2` = Exclusive <br> - `3` = Learn bid on a prefer-learn impression |
| 16 | ym_auction_tier_id | int | If applicable, the ID of the Yield Management Auction Tier into which this bid was categorized. Tiers have a priority, and bids in tiers of higher priority get preference over bids in tiers of lower priority. Sellers can use this information to run auction simulations. For more information, see the [Yield Management Auction Tier Service](../digital-platform-api/yield-management-auction-tier-service.md). |
| 17 | hard_floor | numeric | The hard floor specified in the seller's [Yield Management Profile](../digital-platform-api/yield-management-profile-service.md), in the currency set by the publisher. Defaults to `0` if there was no hard floor on the Yield Management profile. |
| 18 | modified_hard_floor | numeric | The floor actually applied in the auction in USD. This can differ from the value of `hard_floor` due to floor optimization and floor modifiers. Defaults to `0` if there was no hard floor applied in the auction. |
| 19 | soft_floor | numeric | The soft floor (in the seller's local currency) specified in the seller's [Yield Management Profile](../digital-platform-api/yield-management-profile-service.md). Defaults to `0` if there was no soft floor on the Yield Management profile. |
| 20 | modified_soft_floor | numeric | The soft floor (in USD) that is actually supplied in the auction. This can differ from the value in `soft_floor` due to floor optimization and floor modifiers. Defaults to `0` if there was no soft floor applied in the auction. |
| 21 | bid_payment_type | tinyint | How the buyer was to have paid for the impression:<br> - `0` = CPM <br> - `1` = CPC or CPA <br> Defaults to `0`. |
| 22 | is_winning_bid | tinyint | Whether this bid won the impression: <br> - `0` = no <br> - `1` = yes |
| 23 | deal_id | int | The ID of the [deal](../digital-platform-api/deal-service.md) that was used to coordinate this bid on your inventory. Defaults to `0` if no deal was used. |
| 24 | ad_profile_id | int | The publisher-level [ad profile ID](../digital-platform-api/ad-profile-service.md) that was applied to this impression. This is used during bid rejection analysis to let the seller know which ad profile allowed or blocked the creative. Defaults to `0` if no publisher-level ad profile was used. Note that this value will never be the global ad profile. |
| 25 | is_mediated_bid | tinyint | Whether this bid is coming from mediated demand: <br> - `0` = standard <br> - `1` = mediation |
| 26 | raw_net_bid_price | numeric | The buyer's bid converted to USD less the buyer and seller deductions. <br> This value will be identical to the `actual_bid_price` value unless fixed price deals are in place. For a fixed price deal, the `raw_net_bid_price` is the actual bid from the buyer. |
| 27 | external_request_id | string (100) | Specifies the seller's own auction ID that ties the impression back to their own data feeds. (See `external_request_id` under [Standard Feed](standard-feed.md).) |
| 28 | bid_price_type | int | The type of bid price that was used to bid on this impression: <br> - `0 - BID_RESPONSE_TYPE_CPM`: A standard or "regular" CPM bid price. <br> - `1 - BID_RESPONSE_TYPE_PCPM`: A bid price from a Guaranteed Delivery line item with an impression goal. For more information about the available goal types for these line items, see [Guaranteed Delivery](../monetize/guaranteed-delivery.md). <br> - `2 - BID_RESPONSE_TYPE_LEARN`: A "learn" bid price from a buy-side object that was trying to optimize. For more information about learn bids from a buy-side perspective, see [Targeted Learn](../monetize/targeted-learn.md). <br> - `3 - BID_RESPONSE_TYPE_CPVM`: A bid price where buyers pay only for impressions that are measured “viewable”. See [vCPM Payment Type](../monetize/vcpm-payment-type.md) for more information. |
| 29 | hashed_user_id_64 | bytes | The hashed version of the Xandr 64-bit User ID which will we provided as a proxy in certain cases where Xandr is unable to provide the real `user_id_64`. You will not be able to target users via their hashed user ID. However you can use this identifier to calculate unique users, user frequency, and user recency. An example is provided below: <br> `user_id_64:` <br> `XXXXXX304391387YYYY` <br> `hashed_user_id_64:` <br> `0000f47b074866470613d9397f0bd7efa78c7adec992aac5e117cbe2d55993a94767` <br><br> **Note**: If you receive the `user_id_64` version of this field, you will not received the hashed version. |
| 30 | partition_time_millis | UNIX Epoch time | The hourly partition any record row falls into, represented as a UNIX Epoch timestamp value (in milliseconds). Useful for defining hourly partitions when loading into a database or data warehouse. For the Avro format, this field is given the timestamp-millis logical type for native timestamp detection. For example, `1568077200000` can also be represented as *Tuesday, September 10, 2019 1 AM (UTC)*. |
