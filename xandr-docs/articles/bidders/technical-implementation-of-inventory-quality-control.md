# Technical Implementation of Inventory Quality Control



Xandr's inventory solution allows branded
advertisers to buy through our platform and proactively protect their
brand. Xandr has built flexible inventory
quality options to allow you to choose how to protect your brand. We
empower you to choose how you interpret brand quality. We have built
many options for targeting inventory while protecting your brand; you
are empowered to decide how you think about inventory quality and your
inventory selection.



## Implementation

- **Xandr Reviewed Inventory:** If you want to
  ensure that your ads are running on websites that meet
  Xandr's high-quality standards and are
  categorized correctly Xandr has a human audit
  team that has reviewed the top 3,000 domains by volume that run
  through our platform.
- **Work with only the Sellers You Trust:** If you want to expand your
  reach beyond platform-reviewed inventory, you can do this on a
  seller-by-seller basis. You have relationships with other networks and
  we allow you to buy from these partners and trust their category and
  sensitive attribute settings in the platform UI. These supply partners
  know their inventory well.
- **Choose what you consider a "Sensitive Attribute":** We have labeled
  all platform reviewed sites with any applicable sensitive attributes
  and sellers have labeled their inventory, for example: political,
  user-generated content, moderated forums, etc. You decide what types
  of sites you find appropriate or inappropriate for your campaigns.
- **Content Category Targeting:** Xandr has set
  content categories for all reviewed domains and sellers have
  categorized their own inventory. You can choose to target by content
  and how much you trust each seller's categorizations.
