# Anatomy of Forecast Management page

The Forecast Management page on the **Capacity** tab lists all of your products and the current month's impression capacity forecast. From here, you can view a product's details and access its Forecast Visibility page.

## Forecast Management page

There are four sections on the **Forecast Management** page:

- **Configuration panel** – Export the forecast and adjust the time period.
- **Filter panel** – Add and remove product attributes to limit the Products list.
- **Products list** – Displays your products, based on the applied filters. Select a specific product to view its details in the **Product detail preview**.
- **Product detail preview** – This displays a preview of the product selected in the **Products list**. From here you can select the product's name or **View** > **Forecast Visibility** to view the Capacity Forecast.
