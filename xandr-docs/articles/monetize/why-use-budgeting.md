# Why Use Budgeting?



A budget is the amount of money or the number of impressions that a
client wants to spend for a specific insertion order,
line item or campaign. Ideally, this budget
amount is based on the specific business needs or goals of the client.
Once the budget for a campaign (or its parent line item) has been met,
the campaign will no longer bid on inventory, and no creatives will be
served. Budgets can be established on a daily basis, for the lifetime of
the campaign, or for both. It is neither necessary nor required to set a
budget for each campaign; however, not doing so can create very risky
scenarios.

Budgets can also be created for insertion orders and line items. An
insertion order is a parent to one or more line items, and a line item
is a parent to one or more campaigns. When a parent entity (e.g., an
insertion order) reaches its budget amount, any children of that parent
are also restricted from serving creatives. Therefore, if a budget is
established for an insertion order, and it is reached, all line items
belonging to that insertion order (regardless of their budget amount)
cease activity. Subsequently, all campaigns under those lines items stop
serving creatives (again, regardless of their budget amount). This is
one way to reduce the potential of spending a great deal more than
desired (also known as overspend).

When a client sets a budget, that client has determined that they need
to spend a specified amount to get a specific message across and, either
immediately or in the future, recognize a benefit from the campaign
(e.g., larger mailing lists, increased product sales, etc.).

Types of Budgeting

There are many different ways to apply a budget. You can determine
whether your budget is counted in revenue, cost, or in the number of
impressions served. The choice of which to use is up to you, but once
you make a selection, you must count the budget in that manner through
the life of the insertion order, line item or
campaign.

You can apply a budget to an **Insertion Order**, a **Line Item**, or a
**Campaign**:

Budget Caps

The buy-side objects to which you can associate a budget (**Insertion
Order**, a **Line Item**, or a **Campaign**) are hierarchical:

- **Insertion Orders** contain **Line Items**
- **Line Items** contain **Campaigns**

If a parent item has a budget assigned to it, and that budget is
reached, all children under that parent will stop bidding on inventory,
regardless of whether or not they have reached their individual budgets.
Therefore, if one campaign in a line item spikes and exhausts the parent
line item's budget, all campaigns under that line item will stop
bidding, even though they haven't reached their specific budget amounts.

Risks of Not Budgeting

Budgeting acts as a control feature, maintaining an upper limit that the
campaign, line item, or insertion order cannot exceed. Without a budget,
your campaign could continue to win bids and spend money until you
deactivate it. Even in a short time, a campaign can easily spend tens of
thousands of dollars. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that you set
lifetime budgets on your campaigns (daily budgets are also recommended).
It is also recommended that you set both lifetime and daily budgets for
your parent line items and insertion orders. These practices will help
you avoid overspend.
