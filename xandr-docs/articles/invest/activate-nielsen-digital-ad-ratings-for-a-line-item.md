# Activate Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings for a line item

For $0.25 CPM, you can activate Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings (DAR) for your augmented line item. Nielsen DAR is a feature used to measure your line item's performance in reaching a particular demographic (gender and age group) that has no affect on your line item's actual targeting or delivery.

1. Go to the **Measurement** section.

1. Enable **Audience Demo**.

    After Nielsen has confirmed your line item, audience data tracking for your line item's associated creatives begins. A green check mark displays under the toggle switch to indicate that this confirmation has occurred.

    >[!NOTE]
    >It can take Nielsen up to 24 hours to confirm your line item after saving.

1. Set an **On Target % Goal**.

    >[!NOTE]
    >**On Target % Goal** is for reporting purposes to show how your line item is performing and has no effect on your line item's
    performance.

    For information on Nielsen's On Target Percent metric, see [Metrics for Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings](nielsen-dar-metrics.md).

1. Choose a gender demographic:
   - **All**
   - **Male**
   - **Female**

1. Set an **Age Range**.
