# Integrate with PSP





Integrating publisher inventory with Prebid Server Premium (PSP) begins
with a connection to the publisher's ad server. If a customer uses the
Microsoft Monetize Ad Server as their ad server,
they are classified as a Microsoft Monetize Ad
Server publisher. If a customer is on an external ad server, such as
Google Ad Manager, they are considered a direct supply or SSP publisher.
See below for guidance for each type of customer.
