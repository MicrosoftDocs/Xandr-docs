## Overview

The purpose of the Augmented Line Item (ALI) is to streamline a trader's workflow on the Xandr platform. It does this by enhancing already familiar features while providing new options and settings to support more sophisticated users. In addition, the ALI performs various functions in an automated fashion that previously had required tedious manual adjustment and maintenance by traders. As a result, ALI allows traders to rapidly create buying strategies on the platform, provides tools that specifically address trader goals while reducing daily management and overhead.

## Advantages of ALI

When using ALI, you have access to a suite of powerful algorithms and
tools that help you save time and achieve improved performance against
your client's goals. ALI delivers the following benefits to traders:

- Efficient workflows and algorithms.
