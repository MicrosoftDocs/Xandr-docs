# Updates to Imps matched and bid requests sampling

**Release date**: May 3, 2021

As of today, May 3rd, imps matched and bid requests will be randomly sampled at a rate of 10%. The sampled values will be multiplied by 10 to account for the sampling and to give a realistic estimate. This data will affect all deal management and reporting screens; no further deal metrics (bids, imps, errors, etc) will be affected.
