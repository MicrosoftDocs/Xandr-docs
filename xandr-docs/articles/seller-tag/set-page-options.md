# Set page options

This function sets page-level options placements.

```pre
setPageOpts ({parameters})
```

The parameters listed below can be sent as arguments in the function.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `member` | number | The member ID. |
| `publisherId` | number | The `publisherId` can be used when using an inventory code. This ensures the right publisher is used to help pick the correct default placement. |
| `user` | object | Object that specifies information about an external user. See User Object details below. |
| `keywords` | object | A set of key/value pairs applicable to all ad slots on this page. Querystring segments are defined by key/value pairs in this object. Keywords that contain hyphens must be enclosed in single quote marks. Best practice is to always surround keywords with single quotes. A maximum of 100 key/value pairs can be defined at the page level. (Each tag can have up to 100 additional key/value pairs defined.) |
| `disablePsa` | Boolean | Indicates whether all placements should disable PSAs from showing. A value of `true` will disable all PSAs globally. |
| `device` | object | Complex object that declares and overrides the type of device, as populated in the Xandr bid request. See Device Object details below. |
| `enableSafeFrame` | Boolean | Specifies whether all ads will be served in a SafeFrame container. For more information, see the [SafeFrame API Reference](./safeframe-api-reference.md). |
| `app` | object | Complex object that populates app information. It is an object that holds information related to the application. See App Object details below. |
| `consentManagement` | object | Specifies whether consent management is enabled for compliance with the transparency, notice and choice/consent requirements under the US state privacy law via the [Global Privacy Platform](https://iabtechlab.com/gpp), GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive. Consent management is enabled by default. See Consent Management Object details below. |
| `auctionTimeout` | number | The amount of time, in milliseconds, to wait for a bidder to respond to a bid request. |
| `geoOverride` | object | Provides the ability to override IP-based geo location. See Geo Override Object details below. |
| `schain` | object |  Allows publishers to specify their Supply Chain Object for the request they made to the ad server. Further information about the Supply Chain Object spec and its structure can be found with these links:<br> - [https://iabtechlab.com/sellers-json/](https://iabtechlab.com/sellers-json/)<br> - [https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/openrtb/blob/master/supplychainobject.md](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/openrtb/blob/master/supplychainobject.md) |
| `us_privacy` | string | A string that conforms to the [IAB CCPA Compliance Framework](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/ccpa/) requirements. See the code sample in the **US Privacy** section below. <br><br>**Warning**:<br>This parameter is planned be deprecated at a future date. |
| `pageUrl` | string | This field is set to support progressive web apps that uses AST to show ads in their apps. The development framework generates an invalid referrer, that is blocked by our IQ rules.<br>Publishers using AST in their iOS apps, need to set this field to override the default page URL referrer information (normally derived by AST), to  HTTP(s) value they feel best represents the page. This feature is primarily designed for mobile environments where the referrer information may not reflect typical HTTP page URLs. The feature will only activate when the AST tag is loaded within an iOS app webview. |
| `trackingManagement` | object | Object that specifies values for tracking related features related to the auction and creatives (viewability, usersync, etc). See [TrackingManagement Object](#trackingmanagement-object) details below. |
| `renderingManagement` | object | Object that specifies values for rendering related features, which influence how ads are rendered onto a webpage. See [RenderingManagement Object](#renderingmanagement-object) details below. |

## Objects

### App object

Specifies information about the application.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `appid` | object | Object that defines the application identification information. |

Here's an example:

```pre
apntag.setPageOpts({
        app: {
                appid: 'com.mypackage.myapp'
        }
});
```

### Schain object

The feature in AST allows for publishers to perform an optional syntax check on the schain they specify in the config parameter. The syntax criteria is based on the IAB specification for the schain object.

- If the publisher enables the strict option, the config schain object will be checked exactly and if there is an error in the structure, an error message from AST will be thrown in the console and the schain object will not be included in the request to the adserver.
- If the publisher enables the relaxed option, the config schain object will be checked. If is something wrong, a warning message will be displayed in the browser console, but the schain object will still be included in the request to the adserver.
- If the publisher enables the off option, the config schain object will not be checked at all. It will simply be included in the request to the adserver, whether it was correctly formatted or not.

> [!NOTE]
> You need to have the AST debug flag enabled to see the messages in the console.

Here's an example:

```pre
schain: {
  validation: 'strict',  // strict, relaxed, or off - strict is default
  config: {
    ver: '1.0',
    complete: 0,
    nodes: [{

```

### Consent management object

Use this object to specify whether consent management is enabled for compliance with the transparency, notice and choice/consent requirements under US state privacy laws, GDPR, the ePrivacy Directive and [IAB's U.S. Privacy User Signal Mechanism (USP)](https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CCPA_Compliance_Framework_US_Privacy_USER_SIGNAL_API_SPEC_IABTechLab_DRAFT_for_Public_Comment.pdf), which currently covers the [California Consumers Privacy Act (CCPA)](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa). Consent management is enabled by default.

> [!WARNING]
>
> In order for our clients to meet their transparency, notice and choice/consent requirements under US state privacy laws, the GDPR, the existing ePrivacy Directive, Xandr supports the [Global Privacy Platform](https://iabtechlab.com/gpp)(GPP) and the [IAB Europe Transparency Consent Framewor](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/) (the [IAB's U.S. Privacy User Signal Mechanism (USP)](https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CCPA_Compliance_Framework_US_Privacy_USER_SIGNAL_API_SPEC_IABTechLab_DRAFT_for_Public_Comment.pdf) will be deprecated in 2023).
>
>This is a reference for publishers using AST to surface notice, transparency and choice to end users located within regions covered by the above mentioned policies and signal approved vendors and, where necessary, pass consent, to Xandr and demand sources and their vendors through Xandr's platform.
>
>This resource should not be construed as legal advice and Xandr makes no guarantees about compliance with any law or regulation. Please note that because every company and its collection, use, and storage of personal data is different, you should also seek independent legal advice relating to obligations under European regulations, including the GDPR and the existing ePrivacy Directive. Only a lawyer can provide you with legal advice specifically tailored to your situation. Nothing in this guide is intended to provide you with, or should be used as a substitute for, legal advice tailored to your business.
>
>Note our [Service Policies](https://microsoftapc.sharepoint.com/teams/XandrServicePolicies/SitePages/Xandr-Service-Policies.aspx) (for Buying, Selling, and Data Providers) include privacy-specific obligations of which you should be aware.

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `disabled` | Boolean | Set to true to disable consent management functionality. | False |
| `timeout` | Integer | The amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the CMP to respond. | 10000 |

### Disabling consent management

Xandr provides the option to disable all consent management or individual ones per the user's needs.

| Options | Examples |
|:---|:---|
| Disable all consent management | ```//disables all consent management apntag.setPageOpts({ ... // other settings consentManagement: { disabled: true, timeout: 10000 } })```                |
| Disable GDPR only | ```apntag.setPageOpts({ consentManagement: { timeout: 5000, tcf : { disabled: true } } });``` |
| Disable GPP only | ```apntag.setPageOpts({ consentManagement: { timeout: 5000, gpp : { disabled: true } } });```       |

The following describes the functionality of AST in supporting GPP and GDPR compliance when consentManagement is enabled:

- During the Load Tags function call, the AST tag will attempt to fetch the consent data from the IAB-compliant Consent Management Platforms (CMP).
- When it’s time for the AST tag to call ImpBus, the consent information is included in the /ut POST request. Specifically, the consent information is stored under the POST’s data object as:

> [!NOTE]
> The request-building process is paused during the above execution in order to allow new users a chance to complete their consent information. The process will stop waiting after a specified timeout period (default 10 seconds) and finish building the request.

```pre
gdpr_consent : {
    consent_string: 'abc123',
    consent_required: true|false
},
us_privacy: "1YNY"
```

When the CMP fetch fails or the timeout period expires, the consentManagement code will log a warning message to the browser
console, package a consent object in the following manner and include it into the AST request as described.

```pre
gdpr_consent : {
    consent_string: undefined,
    consent_required: undefined
},
gpp_sid: [5]
```

When AST detects TCF 2.0 it will rely on events generated by the CMP. The consent string will be retrieved when any of the following conditions are met:

- The event generated is `useractioncomplete` or `tcloaded`.

- The event generated is `cmpuishown` and `purposeOneTreatment` flag is set to true in the available TCF string.

- The only event generated is `cmpuishown` and a time out occurs.

  In TCF v2.0 if the `gdprApplies` flag is set to true and Purpose One consent is not granted then AST will not include cookies in the `/ut` POST request.

## Global privacy platform

In order to comply with multiple US state privacy laws, Xandr supports the Global Privacy Platform. When AST detects GPP it will rely on events generated by the CMP. The GPP string will be retrieved when any of the following conditions are met:

- The event sectionChange has occurred - This event is called whenever the status or content of a section changes (e.g. consent is obtained).
- The cmpStatus is loaded and the cmpDisplayStatus does not equal visible - This means the CMP code has finished loading (out of the stub phase) and the CMP is not visible to the end-user (which typically means the CMP has prior consent information available).
