# Getting started with ad server 

As an ad server user, you have access to your end-to-end setup of advertiser and publisher information. You can set up publishers and available inventory, as well as advertisers and their selling specifications. This guide will describe some of the functionality available to you, and link you to the vast number of documentation resources that can help you quickly and efficiently set up and maintain your system of buyers and sellers.

With an ad server, you can set up and manage your buy-side systems and your sell-side systems, as well as manage forecasting, priorities, and many other types of functionality between the two.
