# International Creatives



We have many clients running multinational and multilingual creatives
and offers. Please submit multinational creatives for audit as you
normally would. When the creative is of a major multinational brand, we
will add the brand to the brand list and audit the creative as we would
any other creative in our system. When they are submitted for audit,
they will be approved for our supply partners based on their respective
creative requirements. For example, a Bayer advertisement in German
would be marked Bayer, an Orbitz creative in French would be marked
Orbitz. 



## Platform Operations

The Xandr auditing team will continue to test
these creatives for proper display, click-through, and creative and
landing page quality whenever possible. For multinational creatives, it
is even more important for the creative to be well-branded and that the
brand distinctly matches the landing page. The
Xandr auditing team uses translating tools to
determine the brand category and offer of a creative. Our automated
testing tools will continue to monitor the creative's behavior until you
deactivate it.





## Recommendations

- The more obvious the brand alignment between the creative and the
  landing page, the easier it is for the audit team to approve the
  creative.
- While it is great to use geo-targeting in campaigns, make sure that
  the creative landing page is accessible in all geos so that the audit
  team can evaluate it appropriately.
