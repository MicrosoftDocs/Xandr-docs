# Registration Form service

The Registration Form Service allows you to upload the registration forms required by certain states for political advertising purchased by independent expenditure committees. Creatives won't serve in New Jersey or New York State until the form is uploaded and associated with the appropriate insertion order.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - `PUT`and `DELETE`are not supported for this service. Instead of modifying an existing form, you must upload a new form and then associate the new form with the insertion order.
> - You must record the `file-location` specified in the response to the uploaded form so that you can associate the form with the appropriate insertion order. There is no way to retrieve this information later. If you did not record the file location and still need to associate the form with an insertion order, you will need to upload a new form.

### Upload a registration form and associate the form with an insertion order

#### Upload a registration form

In this example, `NYS_Registration_Form_My_Favorite_Candidate.pdf` is the New York State disclosure form for the ad purchase by the independent expenditure committee.

```
curl -b cookies -X POST https://api.appnexus.com/registration-form/upload -F uploadFile=@/users/myname/NYS_Registration_Form_My_Favorite_Candidate.pdf>
```

The response includes the following:

```
{
    "file-path": "https://cleversafe03.appnexus.net/s3/political-ads-forms/p/958/20191010/fd241b14-1620-4e16-99d7-d57b19078649/A01055Registration20180907111141.PDF"
}
```

#### Associate the form with an insertion order

In this example, the insertion order used for political advertisements is `5432`.

```
cat io-registration-form.json
{
 
  "insertion-order": {
    "registration-forms": [
      {
        "file-path": "https://cleversafe03.appnexus.net/s3/political-ads-forms/p/958/20191010/fd241b14-1620-4e16-99d7-d57b19078649/A01055Registration20180907111141.PDF"
