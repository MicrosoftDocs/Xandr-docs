# Monetize Insights for Publishers







Note: This functionality currently is
in **Beta**. It is still under development and may be subject to change
without notice. Contact your Xandr Account
Representative to get enabled.



Monetize Insights delivers actionable data for publishers directly
within the Microsoft Monetize UI. It helps
publishers to save time by removing the need to configure reporting
dashboards or rely on in-depth reporting to access high level inventory
information.

days as compared to 7 days prior to it:

navigation tiles.

Note: Currently, these settings are
under development and are unselectable.







## Ad Quality

Ad Quality shows revenue-impacting
blocks to help in identifying and evaluating opportunities to adjust ad
quality settings. Ad Quality
contains controls for brand safety, technical attributes and other
parameters that can act to block a bid in the auction.

Note: As an organization, we recommend
you to regularly view your Ad Quality settings (at least quarterly) to
make sure that are appropriate and consistent with settings configured
in the other SSPs (that you may also be using to monetize inventory).
Generally, the blocked bid value overestimates potential revenue impact
and is influenced by the price and frequency of the bids that have been
blocked.





The value displayed on Ad Quality
tab is the sum of all blocked bid prices. For example, a $5.8m of
blocked bid value in last 7 days, up 11% compared to prior week shows
that bids with that value have been blocked. This can be used to
directionally assess magnitude of potential revenue opportunities. The
11% increase could be seen as significant and warrant further
investigation by using the Ad Quality tab to understand if a specific
bid rejection is causing this increase.
