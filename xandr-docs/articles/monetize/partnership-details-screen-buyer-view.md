# Partnership Details screen - Buyer view

On the Partnership details screen you can review and manage your relationship with a specific seller. You can track overall spend trends, view your top brands on the seller's inventory, view the seller's top publishers from whom you have purchased inventory, view active and pending deals, and communicate with the seller to negotiate a deal.

## Getting to the Partnership Details screen

To reach this screen, select **Partners** > **Partner Center**.

## Switching to seller mode

If you are a network that also represents sellers, the **Buyers** and **Sellers** tabs display. Click **Sellers** to view the **Partner Center** as a buyer looking for sellers.

## Viewing seller contact info and description

Click on a seller and click **Show Profile** to view profile information the seller has provided, including the main contact's name, phone number, email address, and a description of their business. You can contact the seller directly by sending a message within the **Activity Stream**. For more information about the **Activity Stream**, see the [Communicating with the Seller](#communicating-with-the-seller) section below.

> [!NOTE]
> If the seller has not entered their contact's name, phone number, email address, or a description of their business, then this information will not be available.

## Viewing your performance on the seller's inventory

Click on a seller to view statistics about how your ad campaigns are performing on the seller's inventory. These statistics update every 24 hours.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not purchased any inventory from the seller, there will be no information to display in the dashboard.

### Spend

A graph displays spend from all transactions between you and the seller within the last 30 days. You can use this graph to monitor your activity on the seller's inventory. If you are targeting an active deal, this graph can help give you insight into the deal's effectiveness. Since the spend displayed here reflects all transactions, this graph will not help you keep track of the spend from a specific deal.

There is a data point for every day. Hover over a data point to see the date it represents and the spend amount for that day.

#### Spend by top publishers

A table lists the seller's top publishers from whom you have purchased inventory, listed in order from most to least spend. This information tells you which of the seller's publishers you are performing best on.

## Communicating with the seller

In the **Activity Stream**, the **Messages** tab shows messages between you and the seller along with the number of days since the message was posted. You can use the **Activity Stream** to introduce yourself to a new seller, request changes to your eligibility, allowed payment types, and targeting access, or discuss why your targeting access isn't working for you.

In this section you can:

- **Send a message:** Send the seller a message by typing into the field at the top of the section, and then clicking **Post**. When you post a new message, the system sends a notification to the contact in the seller's profile.
- **View last update information:** Text at the top of the section willnote when the **Activity Stream** was last updated.
- **Hide Activity Stream:** Click the **Hide Activity Stream** icon ("**<**") to collapse the section and provide more working space.

Click on the **Notifications** tab in the **Activity Stream** to view system messages.

### View your settings for the seller

The seller eligibility and inventory trust settings display in the **My Settings for {Seller Name}** section. For more information on seller eligibility and inventory trust settings, see [Set Seller Defaults](set-seller-defaults.md).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Inventory trust settings only apply to standard line item targeting.
> - If you do not set custom settings for the seller, your default settings will apply. For more information on setting default settings, see [Set Seller Defaults](set-seller-defaults.md).

### View the seller's settings for you

The **My Eligibility**, **Allowed Payment Types**, and **Targeting Access** settings the seller has set for you display in the **{Seller Name} Settings for Me** section. The **Targeting Access** settings show you what the seller has exposed or hidden and include the following:

- **URLs** - If domains are exposed, you can more easily target the seller's inventory using allowlists. For more information on targeting URLs, see [Domain Targeting](domain-targeting.md).
- **Categories (Universal)** or **Categories (Custom)** - If Universal or Custom Categories are exposed, you can more easily target via categories. For more information on targeting content categories, see [Content Category Targeting](content-category-targeting.md).
- **Age or Gender** - If age or gender information is exposed, you can target via those demographics. For more information on targeting age or gender, see [Demography Targeting](demography-targeting.md).
- **Placements or Publishers** - If placements or publishers are exposed, you can more easily directly target a placement or publisher. For more information on targeting specific placements or publishers, see [Direct Inventory Targeting (ALI)](direct-inventory-targeting-ali.md) and [Direct Inventory Targeting](direct-inventory-targeting.md).

## Editing partner settings

Click **Edit** in the **My Settings for {Seller Name}** section to manage the inventory trust settings you have set for the seller. For step-by-step instructions on editing a seller's settings, see [Edit Seller Defaults](edit-seller-defaults.md).

## Viewing deals

**Deals** displays the number of deals available to you from the seller. Click the number to display current and past deals from the seller. Each deal displays with additional details, see [Manage Your Deals with Sellers](manage-your-deals-with-sellers.md) for more information.

## Edit a deal

If you would like to make changes to a deal, send the seller a message to discuss your needs (see the [Communicating with the Seller](#communicating-with-the-seller) section below). The seller can then edit the deal.

## Reporting on deals

You can run a report to see how your deals are performing. See [Buy-Side Reporting on Deals](buy-side-reporting-on-deals.md) for more information.

## Viewing packages

**Packages** display the number of packages available to you. Sellers package their inventory to provide special access to their premium inventory, discounted rates, or other opportunities. Click the number under **Packages** to review each package's description, price, and sizes in the **Package Marketplace** to determine if you are interested. Then, add the packages you are interested in to your cart to generate deals. For more information on generating a deal from a package, see [Get Deals from Seller Packages](get-deals-from-seller-packages.md).

## Requesting a custom deal

If you see a package in the **Package Marketplace** that interests you but needs some modification, you can send the seller a message with your request. Click **Request a Custom Deal**, explain your need, and then click **Submit** to post your message in the **Activity Stream** on the **Partner Details** page (**Partners** > **Partner Center**). Use the **Activity Stream** to continue your negotiation with the seller. If the seller agrees to the change you requested, you will need to generate a deal from a package (see below). The seller will then modify your deal to meet your needs.

## Generating a deal from a package

If you are interested in the packaged inventory, you can generate deals between you and the seller. Click **Add to Cart** near the desired packages, then click **Get Deals** to create deals that you can target. For step-by-step instructions, see [Get Deals from Seller Packages](get-deals-from-seller-packages.md).

## Targeting a deal from the Packages tab

If you generated a deal from a package, your deal ID is displayed in the **Selected Packages** section, see [Get Deals from Seller Packages](get-deals-from-seller-packages.md) for more information.

To target a deal:

- For Augmented Line Items, target deals using line item deal targeting. For more information, see [Deal Targeting (ALI)](deal-targeting-ali.md).
- For Standard Line Items, click **Target now!** to instantly create a new campaign targeting the deal or to add the deal to an existing campaign. For complete step-by-step instructions on setting up your campaign, see [Create a Deal Campaign](create-a-deal-campaign.md).
