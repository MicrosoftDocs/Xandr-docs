# Import Users



If you have administrative permissions, you can quickly add multiple
users to yield analytics by importing a CSV (comma-separated values)
file that contains a set of usernames and passwords.

1.  On the Admin Tools menu,
    click Users. The Users page
    appears, displaying a list of all user accounts.
2.  At the bottom of the list, in the CSV
    File field, click Choose
    File. 
3.  In the dialog that appears, select the CSV file you want to import.
4.  Click Import Users. The new
    accounts are added to the list, and the system displays a count of
    the users that were successfully created.
