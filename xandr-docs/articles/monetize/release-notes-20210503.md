# May 3, 2021: Imps Matched and Bid Requests Will Be Sampled at a 10% Rate - Deal Metrics



As of today, May 3rd, imps matched and bid requests will be randomly
sampled at a rate of 10%. The sampled values will be multiplied by 10 to
account for the sampling and to give a realistic estimate. This data
will affect all deal management and reporting screens; no further deal
metrics (bids, imps, errors, etc) will be affected.
