# Solve delivery issues with Order Line Visibility

In addition to being a dashboard for a given order line, you can use the **Order Line Visibility** page as a tool for troubleshooting order line delivery.

## Solve delivery issues by analyzing competition

1. The top of the **Order Line Visibility** page diplays basic information about the selected order line. Click the **Show Details** link to view additional information.
1. The **Trafficked As** field shows the name of the underlying attribute to which the order line is currently targeted. If the order line has gone through targeting changes, expand the list of **Historical Targeting** to show a list of targets as well as the time period for which they were associated with the order line.
1. The **Performance Details** section is a good way to understand the delivery pattern of the order line over time.
1. You can adjust the Time Period to view future delivery, historical delivery, or both. The chart in this section is grouped by day by default. This can help identify uneven delivery or periods when major under-delivery might occur. Click **Show Performance Data** to view a table of statistical details for the order line over its lifetime and the specified date range.
1. Examine the **Competition** tab for order lines that can be adjusted. This is to help the focus order line deliver on pace.
1. The **Competition** tab contains other order lines that are likely to affect the focus order line. This is due to their overlapping inventory requirements. You can mouse over each name in the **Order Line** column to display information for that order line.
