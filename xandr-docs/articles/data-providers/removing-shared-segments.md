# Removing shared segments

There are situations when a segment will need to be removed from our platform. Since there are complex dependencies associated with segment targeting and these dependencies can affect spend for a campaign, it is crucially important to communicate clearly with your clients about changes to these segments.

For instance, let's take a campaign negatively targeting ("excluding") a contextual segment for adult content. If this segment is removed from the platform, it could potentially cause the campaign to spend unchecked. For this reason, it is necessary to reach out to your clients when deprecating a segment.

As a general rule, our mutual clients should be aware of:

- The change in status for the segment (e.g., that it is being deprecated or deleted).
- The date on which the segment will no longer be available.
- The potential impact to their campaigns if no changes are made.
