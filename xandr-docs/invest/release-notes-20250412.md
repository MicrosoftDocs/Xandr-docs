# April 12, 2025 - Insertion Order Auto Allocation

The Insertion Order Auto Allocation feature enables customers to set a budget at the Insertion Order (IO) level and distribute it across Augmented Line items evenly. The system dynamically optimizes budget allocations based on delivery objectives to ensure that budgetary targets are consistently met while minimizing the need for manual intervention by continuously monitoring the delivery of each line item and strategically reallocating budgets from underperforming line items to those successfully meeting delivery objectives.
