# December 7, 2022: Budget Rollover for Line Items





We are releasing a new feature **Underspend Budget Rollover** for line
items for all Microsoft Invest clients. This feature
enables you to:

- extend a past flight, or
- rollover unused budget from a past flight to a future one when it has
  not delivered its entire budget

You will now see line items that have **rollover** eligibility in both
Buyer Monitoring Workflow (BMW) and the Analytics tabs, they will have
our newest **rollover** icon next to budgets.
