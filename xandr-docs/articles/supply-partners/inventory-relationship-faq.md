# Inventory relationship FAQ

**What is Inventory Relationship, and why are we doing it?**

In an effort to maintain transparency and accountability in the supply sold via, sellers will soon be asked to provide information about their inventory sources. The requested information is basic business information about how the inventory is accessed and will be used to support Xandr inventory quality efforts.

Xandr may verify the publisher information with you or the publisher. Any inaccurate information could result in your termination or suspension.

**What is the motivation behind the changes?**

There are talks within online advertising self-regulatory groups to produce similar recommendations for sellers participating in the RTB marketplace. Xandr is embracing this industry push to provide a safer RTB marketplace for buyers. Buyers have long been required to register and audit creatives on Xandr. Inventory Relationship is another step towards accountability on the sell side.

**How should sellers define each Inventory Relationship option?**

For a complete list of fields and their usage requirements, please refer to the [Publisher Service](../digital-platform-api/publisher-service.md) documentation.

**What happens if a seller does not populate the required fields?**

To create or edit publishers in the UI or API, you will have to enter this information where prompted. New publisher objects must have the
proper Inventory Relationship declared. Existing objects should be updated with the proper Inventory Relationship. We recommend making these updates via the [Publisher Service](../digital-platform-api/publisher-service.md).

**How do I complete the Inventory Relationship and Publisher Information fields for small publishers without a company?**

For publishers operating as sole proprietorships under their personal name, please add the payee name in the Business Name field.

**What are the language requirements for the Publisher Information fields?**

Xandr recommends completing the Publisher Information fields in English. However, if this is not possible, the local language may be used.
