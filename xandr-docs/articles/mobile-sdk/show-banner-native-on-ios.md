# Show banner native on iOS

> [!NOTE]
> This offering is currently in Alpha and is subject to change.

The term *Banner Native* refers to the capability of our Mobile SDK
Banner class to return native demand. The banner object (ANBannerAdView)
is multi-format, returning demand for banner ads and, if enabled via the
APIs as described in the examples below, video and native ads.  This
means that you can instantiate a single Banner class object and pass it
a single Member ID and Code (or Placement ID) and access demand across
any or all of banner, video and native Media Type formats.

If you decide not to use the Banner Native capability you won't
notice any significant changes in the manner in which your existing
implementations function.  There are minor changes to the standard
MobileSDK headers (including one iOS header, which has been removed). 
But other than minor, one-time changes to satisfy the compilation
process, there should be no impact on any existing code that uses the
Banner class.

The assumption of this document is that you're already familiar with
both the Banner and Native classes. To use Banner Native there are a
number of significant changes both structurally and procedurally that
you must manage.  The Banner class with Banner Native behaves like the
traditional Native Request class.  When the Banner class returns with a
native ad object, like traditional Native Request, it returns a Native
Response object.  This Native Response object can then be used in the
traditional manner to display and track the ad content of a native ad
object.

## Process changes

As of MobileSDK Version 4.8, there is one breaking change in the
procedure of handling banner and video ad objects via the Banner class. 
Before the introduction of Banner Native, it was possible to add the
Banner class instance view to a view hierarchy, even before the class
instance returned the ad object.  This made it possible to finalize the
display setup of the class even before the lifecycle of loading and
fetching the ad object had completed.  Although this convenient
short-cut meant potentially ignoring the callback that indicates the ad
has loaded, it is a common pattern with the MobileSDK.

If the Banner class is used to fetch native ads, the display step MUST
wait until after the callback has fired.  This is because the callback
provides the delivery point for the native ad object, if it is returned,
and because it is the only place to distinguish between the return of a
native ad object versus a banner or video ad object.





## Mobile SDK Structure

- The `ANAdDelegate` method returns an ad object handler that is defined
  only by id.  (Previous to Version 4.8 the handler was defined
  as id\<ANAdProtocol\>.)
- The `ANAdDelegate` protocol includes the new
  method `ad:didReceivNativeAd:`

Please follow below steps to understand how the
multi-format `ANBannerAdView` is used:

- Enable Native demand for
  your `ANBannerAdView` using `setAllowNativeDemand `method as well
  as `shouldAllowNativeDemand` & `enableNativeRendering` properties. For
  enabling Video demand, use the property s`houldAllowVideoDemand.`

  ``` pre
  /**
   * Sets whether or not Native Ads(AppNexus Media Type:12) can serve on this Ad object.
   *
  */
  @property (nonatomic, readwrite) BOOL shouldAllowNativeDemand;
  /**
   *  If enableNativeRendering is not set, the default is false.
   *  Rendering NativeAd to behave as BannerAd
   */
  @property (nonatomic, readwrite) BOOL enableNativeRendering;
  /**
   * Sets whether or not Video Ads(AppNexus Media Type:4) can serve on this Ad object.
   */
   @property (nonatomic, readwrite) BOOL shouldAllowVideoDemand;
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > As per new enhancements, the `RendererId` is set from the Console instead of it passing from the SDK. Hence, the deprecated message to use `shouldAllowNativeDemand`property is shown in the code block.

- By default these values are set to NO, in which case
  your `ANBannerAdView` will deliver only traditional HTML banner
  ads. You must explicitly enabled native and video in the app.

- Whereas `loadAd` can be called as soon as possible, the banner (or
  video) ad cannot be put into a subview until the
  delegate `adDidReceiveAd:` or `ad:didReceiveNativeAd:` has been
  called.

- A native ad object is returned as an instance
  of `ANNativeAdResponse` which can then be handled like any other
  traditional native response class.  In this
  case, `ANBannerAdView` effectively plays the same role
  as ANNativeAdRequest. (See [Show Native Ads on iOS](show-native-ads-on-ios.md) for more on ANNativeAdResponse.)

- By default, the mainImage and iconImage are not loaded. You can
  manually download these images via the
  properties mainImageURL and iconImageURL, in the
  class ANNativeAdResponse.

## Example:

Usage of the multi-format ANBannerAdView class is simply a combination
of the usage for banner and traditional native classes.

If you want to fetch native or a combination of banner, video, and/or
native, you can use the following code example to get started:

``` pre
/**
 This view displays ads from placements that return banner, video and/or native ads.
 Note the implementation requires delaying the point where the ad is displayed,
   because native ads are displayed with ANNativeAdResponse and because the type of ad must be
   tested after load in order to determine the proper means for display.
*/
 @code
    ANBannerAdView  *banner  = nil;
    - (void) loadMultiFormatAd
    {
        CGSize  size      = CGSizeMake(300, 250);  // NOTE  Setting size is necessary only for fetching banner and video ad objects.
                                                   //       This field is ignored when the placement returns a native ad object.
        CGRect  someRect  = CGRectMake(...);
        // Create the banner ad view here, but wait until the delegate fires before displaying.
        //
        ANBannerAdView  *banner  = [ANBannerAdView adViewWithFrame:someRect placementId:@"<YOUR_PLACEMENT_ID>" adSize:size];
        banner.rootViewController = self;
        // Load an ad!
        [banner loadAd];
    }
    // Display all multi-format ads in success method from ANBannerAdViewDelegate.
    //
    - (void) adDidReceiveAd:(id)adObject
    {
        if ([adObject isKindOfClass:[ANNativeAdResponse class]])
        {
            ANNativeAdResponse  *nativeAdResponse  = (ANNativeAdResponse *)ad;
            MyNativeView        *nativeView        = [[MyNativeView alloc] init];
            nativeView.title.text            = nativeAdResponse.title;
            nativeView.text.text             = nativeAdResponse.body;
            nativeView.iconImageView.image   = nativeAdResponse.iconImage;
            nativeView.mainImageView.image   = nativeAdResponse.mainImage;
            [nativeView.callToActionButton setTitle:response.callToAction forState:UIControlStateNormal];
            nativeAdResponse.delegate = self;
            [nativeAdResponse registerViewForTracking: nativeView
                              withRootViewController: self
                                      clickableViews: @[nativeView.callToActionButton, nativeView.mainImageView]
                                               error: nil
              ];
            [self.view addSubview:nativeView];
        } else {
            [self.view addSubview:banner];
        }
    }
 @endcode
 If this view will be displaying placements that include only banner and/or video ads,
   then display can be (optimistically) handled without using ANBannerAdViewDelegate:
 @code
    - (void) loadMultiFormatAdThatDoesNotIncludeNative
    {
        CGSize size = CGSizeMake(300, 250);
        // Create the banner ad view and add it as a subview.
        //
        ANBannerAdView  *banner  = [ANBannerAdView adViewWithFrame:rect placementId:@"13572468" adSize:size];
        banner.rootViewController = self;
        [self.view addSubview:banner];
        // Load an ad!
        // NOTE  Upon loadAd failure, the view impression simply remains blank.
        //
        [banner loadAd];
    }
 @endcode
```

If the ANBannerAdView will be displaying placements that include only
banner and/or video ads, then display can be (optimistically) handled
without using the adDidReceiveAd : delegate method:

``` pre
@implementation MyViewController
 
- (void) loadMultiFormatAdThatDoesNotIncludeNative
{
    CGSize size = CGSizeMake(300, 250);
 
    // Create the banner ad view and add it as a subview.
    //
    ANBannerAdView  *banner  = [ANBannerAdView adViewWithFrame:rect placementId:@"13572468" adSize:size];
    banner.rootViewController = self;
 
    [self.view addSubview:banner];
 
    // Load an ad!
    // NOTE  Upon loadAd failure, the view impression simply remains blank.
    //
    [banner loadAd];
}
 
@end
```
