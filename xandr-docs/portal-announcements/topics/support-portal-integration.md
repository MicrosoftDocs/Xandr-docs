# Support Portal Documentation Integration 

To help get you the information you need to get back to work faster, in addition to reading documentation in the Documentation Center, you can also view it from within the [Customer Support](https://help.xandr.com) portal.

As soon as you log in to the Support portal \(or visit as a guest\) you'll be taken to the Home page, where you'll see helpful links to documentation on Xandr products, developer resources, and common areas of concern.

If you don't see what you need on the Home page, you can continue to the Contact Support form. From there, as soon as you begin typing in the subject for your support request, you'll see links to documentation matching the subject of your request right in the portal. This gives you the opportunity to check whether there is relevant documentation that addresses your issue before you log the ticket.

Here's a simple example: let's say you have a question about how to use our universal pixel. You start creating a support ticket with that topic in the subject line. As you type, the portal searches our documentation for those keywords and displays matching topics. As you select from the **Category** and **What can we help with?** drop-down menus, the list of topics will be further refined based on your needs.

When you see a topic that matches what you're looking for, simply click the topic to read it! Of course, you can continue creating the ticket if you'd like more personalized assistance from one of our support professionals, but we hope that by providing quick access to our documentation, we can help you resolve your issue faster.

And, you can always come back here to the Documentation Center for full navigation, search, and filtering to help you find what you need.
