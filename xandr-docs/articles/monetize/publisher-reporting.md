# Publisher Reporting





Publisher reports allow you to get more granular information about the
performance of individual publishers than is provided by
<a href="network-reporting.md" class="xref">Network Reporting</a>.
These reports are also designed to contain information that is more
relevant to selling activity than buyer or network reports. Also, if you
only participate in selling activity (e.g., as a Publisher) on the
Xandr platform, these may be the only reports
you have access to.

In this section of the reporting guide, you'll find documentation for
all of our publisher-level reports.
