# Microsoft Monetize - Reporting (mobile-specific)

Xandr has created several reports that let you
focus on mobile-specific data. For more information, see the reports
below.

> [!TIP]
> We've written this document to make it easier to find reports focused on mobile. All these reports are located in the [Reporting Guide](reporting-guide.md), so don't forget to look there as well.

- **[Device Analytics Report](device-analytics-report.md)**  
  Retrieve performance data based on mobile device. This is especially
  important for buyers working with in-app advertisers who traffic
  creatives that encourage app installation and who therefore want
  confirmation that their creatives are targeting devices compatible
  with their apps.
- **[Carrier Analytics Report](carrier-analytics-report.md)**  
  Retrieve performance data based on mobile carrier and connection type.
  This report helps buyers analyze how carriers affect
  line item or campaign performance and
  advertiser payment. Also, in cases where advertisers set up specific
  landing pages for each carrier, this report helps you identify the
  carriers that a line item or campaign ran on.
- **[Network Site Domain Performance Report](network-site-domain-performance-report.md)**  
  Retrieve performance data based on domain or mobile application across
  all of your advertisers. This report helps buyers identify
  high-performing mobile inventory and optimize their targeting.
