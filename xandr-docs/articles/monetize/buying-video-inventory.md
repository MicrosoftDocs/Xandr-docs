# Buying Video Inventory



This page provides you with a suggested workflow to optimize the new
enhancements around our buy-side video offering.

Step 1. Add VAST Video Creatives



You can either opt to have Xandr host your VAST
creatives, or add creatives hosted by a third-party provider. For more
information, see <a href="add-a-creative.html" class="xref"

a Creative</a> and <a href="add-creatives-in-bulk.html" class="xref"
title="You can add multiple third-party, hosted, and native creatives to the Creative Manager simultaneously by either uploading a spreadsheet or the creative files directly from your computer. Only secure content is supported.">Add
Creatives in Bulk</a>.



Note: A contract addendum must be
signed prior to hosting with Xandr. Contact your
Xandr representative for more information.





Step 2. Create Your Buy-Side Setup

Create your ad campaign by following the
<a href="basic-buy-side-setup-procedures.html" class="xref">Basic
Buy-side Setup Procedures</a>.

Step 3a. Target Inventory

Target your own managed video inventory or third-party
inventory. (See
<a href="third-party-inventory-targeting.html" class="xref">Third-Party
Inventory Targeting</a>.)

Step 3b. Target Video (Optional)

Set video targeting parameters to target specific types of inventory.
For more information, see
<a href="video-targeting.html" class="xref">Video Targeting</a>.
For Deals targeting, see
<a href="video-player-targeting.html" class="xref">Video Player
Targeting</a>.



Note: Setting any of the video
targeting parameters will reduce targeting to the corresponding
attributes and will significantly limit your delivery potential.



Step 4. Generate Reports

Run reports to analyze video event metrics and further optimize your
video buying approach. For more information, see
<a href="network-video-analytics-report.html" class="xref">Network Video
Analytics Report</a>.
