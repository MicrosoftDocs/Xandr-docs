# Yield Analytics 8.26

Order Line Visibility: The Yield Analytics 8.26 release includes several user-interface updates designed to increase performance of the Order Line Visibility Page.

The Order Line Visibility page layout contains the same data as before, but is now organized in a tabular format.  The default view provides Performance data for the order line using the configured date range, while the Competition, Consumption, History, and Recommendations information is now available through additional links in the data pane navigation menu (highlighted red in below screenshot). The configuration settings (highlighted orange in below screenshot) for each data view are now displayed within the data pane in the top left-hand corner. Configuration settings allow you to change data groupings, metrics, and filtering within the different informational screens.
