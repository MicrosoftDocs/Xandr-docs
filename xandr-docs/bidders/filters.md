- Click **Filters** to access the **Filters** screen.
- Select the filters you would like to apply. (See [below](filters.md)).
- Once filters are selected, click the **Apply Filters** button. The screen then automatically loads the results, appropriate creatives are listed.
- Clicking the **Cancel** button cancels all filter entries.

The following filtering options are available:

| **Creative IDs** | Click within the **Creative IDs** box to filter for one or more specific creative ids.<br>**Note**: This field is comma separated. To search for multiple creative ids, type **creative id 1**, **creative id 2**, etc. |
| **Creative Code** | Click within the **Creative Code** box to filter for one or more specific creative codes.<br>**Note**:<br> - This creative code that is entered must be exact.<br> - This field is comma separated.
