# Microsoft Curate - June 26, 2023: Troubleshoot seller deal in open Beta

Microsoft Curate clients can now access a curated deal's impression funnel for each targeted seller deal. This feature includes an interactive table that displays the performance of the targeted seller deal at each stage of the impression funnel and how it evolves over time. This will provide valuable insights and help clients optimize their deals for better performance.
