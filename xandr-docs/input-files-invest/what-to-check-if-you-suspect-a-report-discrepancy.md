# What to Check if You Suspect a Discrepancy



Report discrepancies have a number of common causes. Before you begin a
fuller investigation, consider common potential causes like time frames,
time zone differences, measurement units, macro configuration errors,
and differences in how ad servers count impressions.



Before you file a case, consider the following situations that can
create an apparent discrepancy, but are actually the expected result of
either a misconfiguration, or of unlike things being compared.

<p>You can resolve this problem by ensuring that the <code

third-party creatives. This ensures that ads are always pulled from an
ad server, rather than the user's browser cache. For examples of
properly inserted macros for various tag providers, see <a

drop-offs occur when:

<li>something prevents the creative from loading completely (such as a

</ul>
Discrepancies caused by these problems typically occur when a creative
is loaded into a placement at the bottom of a page: in other words, at
the end of the normal chain of page load events. When pages load slowly,
users are more likely to navigate away before the ad tag loads. Mobile
campaigns have a higher likelihood of page drop-off, especially when
served over a carrier connection over a wifi connection.</td>
