# Create a VAST Extension



To avoid having to create VAST extensions for each video creative, you
can create one VAST extension that can be associated with multiple video
creatives.



VAST extensions are custom XML snippets that video players render.





1.  From the
    Network menu, select
    Tools
    \> VAST Extensions.
    

    The Template Manager: VAST
    Extensions screen displays.

    
2.  Click the New
    Extension button.
3.  Enter a new and unique
    Name for your custom
    extension.
4.  Enter the XML for the extension in the
    Content text field using creative
    or custom macro elements.
    

    

    Note: Custom and impbus macros are
    supported. You must define all the custom macros that are listed in
    the Content text field.

    

    
5.  Click the Add
    macro button and do the following:
    1.  Enter the Macro
        name using the XML code provided in the
        Content text field.
    2.  Enter the
        Code for the macro.
    3.  Click the
        Required toggle if this macro
        is required.
    4.  Select a macro
        Type.
6.  Click
    Save.
    

    The extension now displays on the
    Template Manager: VAST
    Extensions screen. You can associate the extension with your
    video creatives using the VAST
    Features section of the Create
    New or Edit screens.
