# Microsoft Invest - A comparison of mobile app vs. web

In [Welcome to Mobile](welcome-to-mobile.md), we claim that mobile app and web features are mostly the same. The table below contains a comparison listing mobile app features, how different they are from web, and how they differ.

For more information about why mobile app features differ from web, see [Technical Limitations of Mobile Buying](technical-limitations-of-mobile-buying.md).

| Mobile Feature | Degree of Difference from Display | Details |
|--|--|--|
| Buying Workflow | Low | - Minor UI workflow differences. <br> - Additional targeting criteria (device, lat/long, carrier). |
| Supply Integrations | Low | - Similar server-side integrations; this will make it easier to bring on mobile supply. <br> - Different, more focused supply sources. |
| Reporting | Low | We have device and carrier reporting; see the [Device Analytics Report](device-analytics-report.md) and the [Carrier Analytics Report](carrier-analytics-report.md). |
| Creative Formats | Medium | - Different sizes. <br> - Device capabilities must be taken into account when targeting. <br> - Pre-loading of interstitials and video required due to battery/bandwidth constraints. |
| Targeting | Medium | - New targeting criteria such as device type, carrier type, and lat/long available. <br> - Most existing targeting methods work as designed. |
| Optimization | Medium | New dimensions such as connection and device types are available to our optimization systems; this will enable the development of more effective mobile-specific optimization algorithms. |
| User identification, Frequency Capping, and Conversion Attribution | Medium-High | See [Technical Limitations of Mobile Buying](technical-limitations-of-mobile-buying.md) |
