# Creating a new Bidder profile

This explains how to create a new bidder profile. There are [seven targeting options](bidder-profile-targeting-options.md) that must be set up as part of this process.

1. Click **New** on the upper left-hand portion of the **Profiles** screen.
1. Assign the profile a **Name**: (*Example: Main Profile*)
1. Click **Enter**. The new profile will now appear in the table on the left side of the screen.
1. There is an optional Code field directly below the name. This can be used as an alternative identifier for the bidder profile.
1. Make adjustments to the seven targeting options on the right side of the screen. They are:
    - [Unknown Users](unknown-users.md)
    - [Countries](countries.md)
    - [Domain Lists](domain-lists.md)
    - [Ad Types](ad-types.md)
    - [Supply Types](supply-types.md)
    - [Exchanges and Members](exchanges-and-members.md)
    - [Sensitive Attributes](sensitive-attributes.md)
1. Once you make of of your adjustments, **Save** the profile. An **ID** for that profile will populate the **ID**: field. This is located in the upper left-hand corner of the screen. It will also populate the table on the left. (**ID, Name, Code**)
