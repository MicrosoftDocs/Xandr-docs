Step 3. Preview the creative

The creative preview is available for you to review once it is fully
uploaded. You have the option to choose a different file, if required.



<b>Note:</b> **.mov** videos will only play in
preview on the Safari browser.



Step 4. Define the creative content

The Name field is auto-populated with
the name of your file. Enter a **Click-through URL** to redirect the
user upon clicking.

Step 5. Select audit options

On the Creative Attributes tab, select
whether you want to submit the creative for
Xandr audit, classify the creative yourself, or
exempt the creative from auditing entirely.

- **Platform Audit** - Submit the creative for auditing by the
  Xandr audit team.  
  Audit process includes:
  - checking technical and content criteria

  - offer type categorization to enable the seller protection features
    on the platform

  - requirements of sellers

    Xandr audit is mandatory but you can opt out
    of other platform specific audits.

  - Select your audit **priority**.

    

    <b>Note:</b> Business days are from 9:00pm
    Sunday to 11:59pm Friday ET.

    

    For more information about content standards for creatives running
    on the Xandr platform, see
    <a href="creative-standards.md" class="xref"
    title="Xandr has foundational policies that all creative and inventory content must follow. Creatives that violate these policies will be removed from the platform, and will be ineligible for both real-time bidding (RTB) and in-network buying. Repeated violation of these policies may result in strikes against offending members.">Creative
    Standards</a>.
- **Self-Audit** - Classify the creative yourself.
  

  

  <b>Note:</b>
  - Self-auditing may reduce access to inventory outside of the ones you
    manage or own, as many sellers allow only
    Xandr audited creatives. For further
    guidance on self-classifying, see
    <a href="self-auditing-creatives.md" class="xref"
    title="When adding creatives to Xandr, it&#39;s to your advantage to submit each creative to Xandr for human auditing. The manual audit process includes checking technical attributes, sensitive categories, offer category, brand, and language to enable seller protection features on the platform.">Self-Auditing
    Creatives</a>.
  - You must check the **I confirm compliance** checkbox in order to
    save the creative.

  

  
- **No Audit** - An unaudited creative can run **only** on your managed
  publishers. It will not be eligible to run on third-party inventory
  unless the seller has opted into allowing unaudited creatives to run
  on their inventory.

Step 6. Add companion banner creatives (optional)

You can now add companion banners to your video creatives. Search for,
and select banner ads that you have previously uploaded via the normal
upload process.



<b>Note:</b> You can only use banner creatives
that have been previously uploaded.



Step 7. Attach third-party and segment tracking pixels (optional)

Xandr records all impressions. If you wish to
use another system to track impressions in addition, you can attach
third-party tracking pixels to your creative.

To attach an existing **third-party pixel** to this creative, select the
type of pixel from the **Event** drop-down menu.

Enter **URLs** for each tracking pixel event.

You can also attach **segment pixels** to your creative. Search for
existing segment pixels and select from the list.

Step 8. Save the creative

Once you have defined your creative and populated the associated fields
as necessary, click Save. The creative
will be listed under Creatives on the
Creative Manager screen.
