# Microsoft Monetize - Export conversion pixels

Once you've finished setting up conversion pixels, you can export the tags and give them to your advertisers for inclusion on pages.

## Step 1. Get started

Go to the **Conversion Pixels** screen (**Advertisers >  Conversion Pixels**), select the checkboxes next to the conversion pixels that you want to export,
click **More Actions**, and select **Export**. This displays the **Export Pixels** dialog.

## Step 2. Select the pixel format

In the **Basic Options** section, select the format for your exported pixels:

- **Use a JavaScript tag** - By default, pixels will be exported as image tags. If you want JavaScript tags instead, select this option.
  
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Why use JavaScript tags? Some advertisers require JavaScript tags. Image pixels can only perform one redirect, so parent pixels with multiple piggybacks must be JavaScript.
  > If a piggyback pixel is  JavaScript, the parent pixel should be JavaScript as well.

- **Generate a non-secure pixel** - Select this option to generate a non-secure pixel. See [Conversion Pixels Advanced](conversion-pixels-advanced.md) for additional details.

## Step 3. Select the delivery options

In the **Delivery Options** section, select whether you want to generate the tags on the screen, or whether you would rather send the tags via email. If you select to email the
tags, you can enter up to 10 email addresses, separated by commas.

## Step 4. Explore advanced options

In the **Advanced Options** section, you can select additional values to include in the pixel tag.

Select **Use codes** to generate a pixel with your external code (the value you entered when creating the pixel) and your member ID instead of the Xandr pixel
ID.

Select **Use a server-side pixel** to generate a URL that you can call, instead of an HTML-based pixel that is placed on a publisher's web page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can select this option on its own, or in conjunction with the **Use codes** option above.
> [!NOTE]
> If you have selected this option you will not be able to select the **Add user to segments** or **Remove user from segments** options, or the **Include a redirect URL** parameter. For more information on server-side conversion pixels, see [Server-Side Conversion Pixels](server-side-conversion-pixels.md).

- Select **Add user to segments on call** to generate a pixel that will add the user to segments once they have converted. After selecting this option, click **Add** near the desired segments to move them from the Available Segments area to the Targeted Segments area. For more information, see "Segment Users Once They Have Converted" under [Conversion Pixels Advanced](conversion-pixels-advanced.md).

- Select **Remove user from segments on call** to generate a pixel that will remove the user from segments once they have converted. After selecting this option, click
  Add near the desired segments to move them from the Available Segments area to the Targeted Segments area. For more information, see "Segment Users Once They Have Converted" under [Conversion Pixels Advanced](conversion-pixels-advanced.md).

- Select any or all of the pixel parameters to add dynamic revenue, ID or SKU, or a redirect URL to the pixel tag. For more information, see the "Order ID/SKU", "Dynamic Revenue Values", and "Redirect URL" under [Conversion Pixels Advanced](conversion-pixels-advanced.md).

## Step 5. Generate the tags

Click the **Generate Tags** button. Depending on the delivery option selected, the tags either are displayed on the screen or emailed to the addresses specified.

An image pixel looks like this, with a `t=2` parameter:

```
<!-- Conversion Pixel - Registration - DO NOT MODIFY --> 
<img src="media/px?id=7313&t=2" width="1" height="1" /> 
<!-- End of Conversion Pixel --> 
```

A JavaScript pixel looks like this, with a `t=1` parameter:

```
<!-- Conversion Pixel - Registration - DO NOT MODIFY -->
<script src="http://ib.adnxs.net/px?id=7313&t=1" type="text/javascript"></script>
<!-- End of Conversion Pixel -->
```
