# Microsoft Invest - Metrics for Nielsen digital ad ratings 

Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings (DAR) introduces an exclusive set of metrics
for tracking a line item's audience demographic targeting success within
Microsoft Invest. If you've enabled Nielsen DAR for
your line item, you'll be able to track a series of metrics across
reports and in your line item's
**Analytics** tab.



The following Nielsen DAR metrics will help you track and improve your
line item's audience demographic targeting:

| Reporting Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| Total Impressions | The total number of impressions your line item has made |
| Audience Share (%) | The percentage share of the total audience a line item has reached within a certain demographic group. This measurement is rounded to two decimal places.<br> - Audience Share (%) = Row Level Audience Count ÷ Campaign Total Audience Count × 100 |
| Audience Reach (%) | The percentage of the population reached within a given demographic<br> - Audience Reach (%) = Unique Audience ÷ Demographic Population × 100 |
| On Target Percent (%) | The percentage of impressions served to your targeted demographic<br> - On Target Percent (%) = Impressions Seen by Target Demographic ÷ Total Impression Count for your Line Item × 100 |
| Unique Audience | The number of unique individuals in the audience that your line item reached |
| On Target Impressions | The number of impressions served to your desired demographic group that are within your selected reporting dimensions |
| Average Frequency | The average number of times a unique audience member viewed your line item's creatives<br> - Average Frequency = Impressions ÷ Unique Audience |
| Gross Ratings Point (GRP) | The amount of times your line item actually reached your target audience<br> - GRP = (% of Population that Saw the Ad at Least Once × Number of Times the Average Viewer Saw the Ad) × 100 |
| Population Share (%) | Percentage of people within a demographic relative to the total population<br>- Population Share (%) = Demographic Population ÷ Population of all Demographics × 100 |
| Impressions Share (%) | Based on the line item's total impression count, the percentage that served to your targeted demographic<br> - Impressions Share (%) = Demographic Impressions ÷ Total Number of Impressions Across all Demographic Groups × 100 |
| Population | Based on census-provided data, the number of people in the country included in a given demographic<br> - Example: F18-24 = 14.9 million |
| Impressions Index | A targeting success score based on how the line item's impressions are divided across all demographics<br> - Impressions Index = Impression Share (%) ÷ Demographic-Specific Population × 100 |
| Audience Index | A targeting success score based on audience share. This is always a whole number.<br> - Audience Index = Audience Share (%) ÷ Population Share (%) × 100 |
