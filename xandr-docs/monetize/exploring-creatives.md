# Microsoft Monetize - Exploring creatives

You can work with creatives from the **Creative Manager** screen. From there you can view the creatives that are associated to a particular advertiser as well as add and update creatives.

The **Creative Manager** screen shows all the creatives associated with the selected advertiser. For each creative, the following information is displayed:

- **Name**: The name of the creative that was provided on the **Create New** screen.
- **ID**: Unique identifier assigned to the creative.
- **Status**: Displays standard creative checks like click test, rendering, etc.
- **Preview**: Allows a user to see what the creative looks like. The user can also copy a preview link to easily share the creative preview.
- **Type**: Creative type such as video, native, audio, and banner.
- **Creative Properties**: The property of the creative. For example: HTML5, Expandable, Interstitial, High Impact, etc.
- **Creative Audit**: The audit status of the creative, which may be Platform, No Audit, and Self-Audited.
- **Impressions**: Total number of impressions delivered. For video ads, an impression is delivered when the first frame of the video is loaded.
- **Clicks**: Total number of clicks.
- **CTR%**: Ratio of clicks to impressions (clicks/impressions x 100), expressed as a percentage.
- **VCR%**: Ratio of video completions to impressions (video completions/total impressions x 100), expressed as a percentage.
- **Viewability Rate%**: The percentage of impressions that were viewable out of the total number of impressions measured for viewability (viewed impressions/view-measured impressions x 100). If the viewability threshold is targeted, the viewability rate is compared to the predicted threshold that is calculated by dividing total views by total impressions.
- **Conversions**: Total number of post-view and post-click conversions.
- **Conversion Rate%**: Ratio of conversions to impressions (conversions/impressions x 100), expressed as a percentage.
- **Tracking**: When adding creatives, you can set a variety of tracking parameters from the **Pixels (optional)** section, such as frequency and recency caps, third-party tracking pixels, and segment pixels. For more information, see [Configuring Tracking for Creatives](../monetize/configuring-tracking-for-creatives.md).
- **Line Item Association**: Displays the number of Line items selected.
