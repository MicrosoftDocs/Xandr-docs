# Change your default home Page

You can change the page that loads by default when you log in to Yield Analytics:

1. In the top right corner of any page, click your name, and then click **Preferences**. The **Preferences** page loads.
1. In the **Set Defaults** panel, in the **Home Page** field, click the link for the current setting (e.g., Availability). Select a different page from the drop-down list that appears.
1. Click **Save Defaults**. The page you chose is displayed, and loads by default the next time you log in to the system.
