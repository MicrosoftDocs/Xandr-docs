# Mediation FAQs

> [!NOTE]
> Mediation is available only to Microsoft Monetize Ad Server customers.

This page has answers frequently asked questions about selling inventory
through mediation.

## What is a network?

Under the hood, a mediated network is actually a managed advertiser. For
this reason, if your client has any managed advertisers with the same
name as one of the mediated networks we support, you will get an error
when trying to add the network. You will need to rename any managed
advertiser to a different name as mediated networks cannot be renamed.

## How is mediation different from RTB?

In a mediation auction, no bids are placed upfront. Selling inventory
through mediation requires running the auction using an estimated bid
that represents what we think the buyer will eventually pay. We later
pull reporting data that shows the buyer's actual bid.

For more information about mediated auctions, see the examples in [How Auctions Work for Sellers](mediation-how-auctions-work-for-sellers.md).

## Why do I get an error when I try to add a network?

A mediated network is actually a managed advertiser "under the hood". If
your client has any managed advertisers with the same name as one of the
mediated networks we support, you will get an error when trying to add
the network. You will need to rename any managed advertiser to a
different name as mediated networks cannot be renamed.

## What happens if the highest bid is a mediated network, and they don't want the impression?

If they return a "no bid" or they timeout, our system automatically
redirects to the next highest bid, whether that be another network, your
own managed campaigns, or the highest RTB bid.

For more information about how auctions work for sellers using
mediation, see the examples in [How Auctions Work for Sellers](mediation-how-auctions-work-for-sellers.md).

## Why doesn't every network give me the option to enter my credentials?

We limit automated reporting to networks where we have significant
demand from clients. We will only ask for credentials for networks where
reporting can be automated.

## What are the APIDS, SPOT IDS, and other fields I am asked to fill in when creating a bid? Why is it different for each network?

Each mediated network requires us to pass the equivalent of a placement
ID in the request for an ad. Every network calls their placement IDs
something different and in some cases multiple IDs are required. The UI
will prompt you for the appropriate IDs from each network to ensure
proper setup.

It's very important to fill in these IDs correctly. We use these IDs to
ensure that reporting data is correct.

## How often is reporting from mediated networks updated?

We update reporting once per day for all supported networks. Typically
you can expect to see third-party data updated in your account by 8 am
EST.

## Which time zone is mediation data reported in?

Under the Networks and Bids tabs, all data is reported relative to the
network time zone. For example, Millennial Media reports its data in
UTC. Therefore, the impression requests, impressions, fill rate and
discrepancy metrics for Millennial Media are all reported in UTC.
Likewise, AdMob reports in PST, so all data for AdMob is reported in
PST. If you look at the data in the mediation screens and compare it to
data in each third-party network's reporting UI, they should match.

In the Network Analytics report, we only adjust revenue from third-party
networks and not impressions. Revenue is adjusted in the default time
zone of the member.

## Where can I find mediated networks and bids in reporting?

- Mediated networks can be found under the Advertiser filter and
  dimension in the Network Analytics Report.
- Bids can be found under the Line Item filter and dimension in the
  Network Analytics Report.

## Do you support passbacks for mobile web and desktop impressions?

Yes.

## Can I add multiple logins for the same network?

This is not supported at this time.

## Which mediation browsers are supported?

Our mediation scripts currently support the following browsers.

When the mediation script encounters a browser that isn't supported, it
will bypass all the mediated bids and call back to impbus for a
response. The response can be to proceed to RTB, or serve a PSA, default
creative, or blank, based on default action settings for the seller and
placement.

## Which mediation networks are supported?

The table below lists the external mediation networks we support. It
includes information about the type of integration we have with each
network, and whether we pull reporting data from that network.

The Integration Type column describes how the network is integrated for
mediation.

- Client indicates that the integration occurs on the client side; works
  only on the desktop web and mobile web.
- Server indicates that the integration occurs on the server side; works
  on mobile web and mobile apps, but works best on mobile apps.
- SDK indicates that the network's SDK must be downloaded and
  implemented. Works only on mobile apps.

> [!WARNING]
> We will make our best effort to keep this information up to date. However, more current information may be available directly from the networks.
