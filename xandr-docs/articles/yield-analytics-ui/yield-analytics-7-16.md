# Yield Analytics 7.16





## Product Permission Enhancements

- When selecting Parent Products to a User Group on the Permissions
  page, you have the ability to view current associated overlaps. This
  is helpful when considering a Permission Product. Click on View
  Overlaps.
- Availability Lookup has additional analysis and result information
  when deducing Child/Twin Product relationships for Dynamic
  Availability Lookups. The (i) icon provides information for these
  cases:
  - Where there is no Capacity (0) and Availability (0), values are
    visible in the row.
  - Where the Dynamic Lookup expresses an Overlap Type which is not a
    Twin, Self or Child, information on the Overlaps analyzed is
    provided.
