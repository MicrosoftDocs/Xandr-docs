# Anatomy of the Capacity Dashboard Page



The Capacity Dashboard page is the
primary view for the Capacity tab. It
provides a snapshot of your capacity for products and product groups, as
well as a tasks panel to navigate to forecasts and add adjustments. It
is displayed automatically when you click
the Capacity tab.


## About the Capacity Dashboard Interface

The Capacity Dashboard is comprised of three widgets:

- Impression Capacity – Displays impression capacity for products in the
  specified product group for a date range.
- Manual Adjustments & Holidays – Displays manual forecast adjustments
  and holidays within the specified date range.
- Capacity Trended – Displays impression capacity over time for the
  selected product. Mouse over a green bar to view the impression
  capacity for the date range.

For each widget, you can:

- Click Reset to reset the widget.
- Click View All to display the full
  report in the Reports tab with the
  metrics already selected. 

To the left of the widgets is the Capacity Tasks panel. This is where
you can select between two options to view and adjust forecasts.

- Adjust Manual Forecast – Make a manual adjustment to a product's
  forecast.
- Adjust Seasonal Forecast – Make a seasonal adjustment to your
  network's seasonal products.

Below the Capacity Tasks panel is the Processing Summary panel. This
indicates when the capacity forecast was last updated.
