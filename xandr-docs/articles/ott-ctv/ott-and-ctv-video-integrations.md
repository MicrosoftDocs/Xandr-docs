# OTT and CTV Video Integrations





Xandr supports integrations with various OTT
hardware platforms, including CTV, to enable client-side ad insertion
through tags or client-side SDKs. Currently, AppleTV is the only
platform that is supported with an SDK.

Additional OTT-capable device SDKs are in development. If you're
interested in developing an integration for a different platform,
contact your Xandr representative about beta
programs for these upcoming integrations.
