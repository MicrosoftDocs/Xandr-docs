# Working with Insertion Orders



Insertion orders allow you to easily manage collections of line items
that may share a common budget, time span, and business terms. Insertion
orders are a standard part of the
<a href="object-hierarchy.html" class="xref">Object Hierarchy</a>. An
insertion order can contain one or more line items. For example, you may
want to set a common budget and billing periods for several line items,
but have each line item target a different region or buy different types
of media.



Note that there are two types of insertion orders (for more information,
see <a href="create-an-insertion-order.html" class="xref">Create an
Insertion Order</a>):

- Legacy - Legacy insertion order
  required for legacy guaranteed and non-guaranteed line items.
- Seamless - Seamless insertion order
  compatible with augmented line items (ALI), guaranteed delivery
  augmented line items (GDALI), and programmatic guaranteed line items
  (PGLI).

Some useful procedures when creating and working with insertion orders
are:

- **<a href="create-an-insertion-order.html" class="xref">Create an
  Insertion Order</a>** - Set up an insertion order (formerly "seamless
  insertion order") in Microsoft Monetize.
- **<a href="create-a-legacy-insertion-order.html" class="xref">Create a
  Legacy Insertion Order</a>** - Set up an old-style insertion order in
  Microsoft Monetize. Legacy insertion orders do not
  use billing periods, can't be used with the recommended augmented line
  item, and are no longer the best practice.
- **<a href="explore-insertion-orders.html" class="xref">Explore Insertion
  Orders</a>** - View essential metrics about insertion orders under a
  specific advertiser, get quick access to each insertion order's
  details and child line items, and use bulk editing and reporting
  options.
