# Deal list service

A deal is an agreement between a buyer and a seller that provides special access to inventory and/or data. Deals are primarily used to access preferred premium inventory or negotiated inventory. A deal list is a group of deals IDs categorised under a heading for targeting across line items. Deal lists allow inventory specialists to curate deals inventory for traders as well as streamline trader workflows like targeting the same set of deals across line items. If deal grouping requirements change, only making required changes in the deal list will automatically update all line items accordingly.

Deal List API facilitates search, add, modify, and fetching a specific or different deal lists. It allows you to create, append and replace a deal list with comma-separated deal IDs.

> [!NOTE]
> All query parameters in Deal List service support a list of comma separated values. For example, to delete a set of deal lists, a comma separated list of IDs can be passed as query parameters.
