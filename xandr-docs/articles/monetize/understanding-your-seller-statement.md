# Understanding Your Seller Statement





As a member who sells inventory on Xandr's
platform, you receive a monthly statement indicating the amount of
revenue you have earned. This page explains the three types of seller
statements. Your contract terms define the type of statement you will
receive.

<div id="understanding_your_seller_statement__p-6bad414e-a609-4dc4-9f7f-11bf48ea1d20"
>



Note: Your statement is delivered in
your default currency. Although all transactions are recorded in US
dollars, those dollar amounts are converted to your default currency (at
the end of the the activity period reflected in the statement).
Xandr uses the Reuters conversion rate at the
end of the activity period to prepare your statement. We also account
for hedging cost as per your contract. The amounts on your statement are
converted by multiplying the US dollar amount by the conversion rate
less the hedging cost.







Note: If you selling activity incurs ad
serving charges and/or your contracted terms with
Xandr has the Seller Auction Service Charge set
as a Fee instead of a Deduction, you will also receive an invoice from
Xandr. For details on seller-specific charges
that can appear on an invoice, see
<a href="understanding-your-invoice.html" class="xref"

Your Invoice</a>.

## Seller Activity Statement

Report in the UI. Your Seller Activity Statement will be automatically
emailed to the individual within your organization who is responsible
for seller activity. If you have any questions, contact
Xandr Client Finance:

## Netting Statment

<div id="understanding_your_seller_statement__p-0fc0dedd-b69f-49d9-a300-a3fd380808ec"
>



Note: You only receive a Netting
Statement if you conduct both buying and selling activity with
Xandr, have contractually agreed to netting and
notified the Client Finance team to enable netting for your account





This monthly document lists the amount of revenue you have earned as a
seller as well as your activity as a buyer.
Xandr then deducts the amount that you owe as a
buyer from the revenue you have earned as a seller to determine the
amount you will be paid or that you owe.

To have newly added seats included in your netting calculation, contact
Client Finance: <a href="mailto:billing@xandr.com" class="xref"
target="_blank">billing@xandr.com</a>.

1.  **Client Information** - This includes the client name and address.

2.  **Payment Terms** - Your seller payment terms followed by your
    invoice (buyer) payment terms, as specified in the Payment Terms
    section of your Xandr Service Exhibit.
    Standard netting terms are 30 days for buyers to pay
    Xandr and 60 days for
    Xandr to pay sellers. As a result, your
    netting statement will offset seller activity with buyer activity
    (both from the previous month). For example, selling activity for
    March 2017 will be offset against your February 2017 to April 2017
    invoices.

    1.  Seller payment terms, in the upper right hand corner of the
        statement - the time period in which
        Xandr must pay the amount due to the

        statement - the time period in which you must pay the amount due
        to Xandr.

    Your Invoice</a>.

7.  **Total Payable / Due** - The amount that you owe
    Xandr for your buying activity during a
    specific period (i.e., the difference between the total seller
    revenue and total invoices). Please note that finance fees are not
    included.
