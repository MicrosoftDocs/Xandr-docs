# Working with saved reports

This article explains about the functionalities that an administrator can perform on reporting.

## Add a report category

Use the **Filters** panel on the left to locate Saved Analyses by Name, Category, Recipients and/or Status. Use the **Manage Categories** button to create new and remove or edit existing report categories. These categories will be reflected in the Analyzer **“Open”** dialog.

## Edit report categories

1. Go to the **Analyzer Screen** and click on the open button located on the top left hand corner.
1. Use the search and filter options to find the **Analyzer Report** you would like to edit.
1. Click the **Reports Name** to open it.
1. At the top of the **Edit Saved Analysis** screen click on the save button. You will have options to change the **Report's Name**, **Description**, and **Category**.
1. To create a **New Category**, click the **Add New** link beside the category drop down menu.

## Filter the list of saved reports

To filter the list of saved reports, you will want to search either based on category that the report is in, or by the report name itself.

When saving the report you have the option to Set as Default as a check box item within the save functionality. This default report will be unique to your login, and others can choose their own default.

## Schedule a saved report

You can share the report with one or more user groups by selecting Group(s) from the left-hand list. When the Group appears on the right, select the **Allow Editing** button to let people in this Group edit and save over your report. To remove a Group from the shared list, click the red "x" icon next to the name of the Group.

1. Name the report.
1. Set the recurrence.
1. Input the email addresses that you would like to receive your report and any special message you would like the email to contain.
1. Click if you would like a link to the report and/or a snapshot.
1. Select the type of file you would like the attachment to be in the dropdown.
1. Click **Save**.

If the Analysis has been scheduled for delivery using the **Send** button in Analyzer, an entry will appear in the Schedules for Analysis table. Click the **Edit** button to make changes to a Report's analysis schedule. Note that the **Save** button is not required to commit the schedule changes.
