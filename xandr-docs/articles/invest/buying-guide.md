In This Guide

- <a href="ad-buying-with-xandr.md" class="xref">Ad Buying with
  Xandr</a>: The combination of market positioning and single-point
  access to programmatic buying features through Invest
  DSP add up to unparalleled advantages for ad buying.
- <a href="basic-buy-side-setup-procedures.md" class="xref">Basic
  Buy-side Setup Procedures</a>: This overview walks through the
  essential procedures used to set up ad purchasing in
  Invest DSP.
- <a href="working-with-advertisers.md" class="xref">Working with
  Advertisers</a>: The advertiser object is the top level of the
  buy-side hierarchy (Advertiser \> Insertion
  Orders \> Line Items). Before you can set up line items to
  define your financial agreement and then start running campaigns and
  serving creatives on behalf of an advertiser, you must set up the
  advertiser itself.
- <a href="working-with-insertion-orders.md" class="xref">Working with
  Insertion Orders</a>: Insertion orders allow you to
  bucket line items under an advertiser (Advertiser \> Insertion Order
  \> Line Items).
- <a href="working-with-line-items.md" class="xref">Working with Line
  Items</a>: A line item defines your financial agreement with an
  advertiser, including how much the advertiser has allocated for you to
  spend (budget), the basis on which the advertiser has agreed to pay
  you (revenue type), and performance requirements the advertiser
  expects you to meet (advertiser goals).
- <a href="working-with-programmable-splits.md" class="xref">Working
  with Programmable Splits</a>: Programmable splits let you automate ad
  targeting using rulesets to ensure your ads are delivered and your
  budget is allocated to very specific segments.
- <a href="working-with-segments.md" class="xref">Working with
  Segments</a>: Segment pixels use information about a user, such as
  webpages they visit, actions they take, or qualities such as gender,
  location, and wealth, to assign that user to a group called a segment
  for future targeting.
- <a href="working-with-conversion-pixels.md" class="xref">Working with
  Conversion Pixels</a>: Conversion pixels are used to track user
  actions in response to advertisers' creatives, such as registering at
  a site or making a purchase. When a conversion pixel fires,
  Xandr determines if the conversion (the
  registration, the purchase, etc.) can be "attributed", or tied to the
  user clicking on or viewing one of the advertiser's creatives
  previously.
- <a href="working-with-impression-and-click-trackers.md"
  class="xref">Working with Impression and Click Trackers</a>:
  Impression and click trackers are used to track impressions and clicks
  associated with creatives that are hosted by off-platform
  (non-Xandr) ad servers. This is done by
  attaching the tracker as a "piggyback pixel" on the externally hosted
  creative. This lets you report on impressions and clicks on these
  creatives as if they were hosted by Xandr.

- <a href="welcome-to-mobile.md" class="xref">Welcome to Mobile</a>:
  Advertising on mobile devices is mostly similar to traditional display
  advertising (and where it differs, we'll explain those differences).
  This section is designed to provide you with a solid understanding of
  how advertising works on mobile devices.
- <a href="introduction-to-viewability.md" class="xref">Introduction to
  Viewability</a>: Understand how Xandr measures
  ad views, and optimize the chances of your audience viewing your
  creatives.
- <a href="buying-video-inventory.md" class="xref">Buying Video
  Inventory</a>: This guide provides advanced video reference
  information as well as information about buying in-stream, out-stream,

- <a href="buying-audio-inventory.md" class="xref"
  title="You can buy audio inventory on Xandr using our optimized buy-side workflow.">Buying
  Audio Inventory</a>: This guide provides information about buying
  audio inventory.
- <a href="buying-native-inventory.md" class="xref">Buying Native
  Inventory</a>: Websites that sell native inventory accept ad content
  but enforce their own display properties to integrate. This guide
  describes how to buy native inventory on properties that allow it.
- <a href="data-marketplace-buyer-overview.md" class="xref">Data
  Marketplace - Buyer Overview</a>: Xandr
  supports automatic clearing of third-party segment data you can
  purchase and use to target audience segments.
- <a href="create-a-user.md" class="xref">Create a User</a>: You can
  create advertiser users for advertisers that want to run reports for
  themselves. An advertiser user does not see data about any other
  advertisers and does not have editing capabilities.
