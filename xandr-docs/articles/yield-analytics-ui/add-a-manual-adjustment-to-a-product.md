# Add a Manual Adjustment to a Product



Add a manual adjustment to a specific product to make a temporary
override to it (e.g., if a sale is driving traffic to a particular
site).

1.  Check the impression capacity for the product for which you want to
    add a manual adjustment.  
    Or, in the Capacity Tasks panel,
    click Adjust Manual Forecast,
    select the product in the Products panel, and then in
    the Product detail preview
    click View
     \>  Forecast
    Visibility.
2.  On the Forecast Visibility page, below the Capacity Forecast, in
    the Adjustments Influencing
    Forecast section, click
    the Add/Edit button. The page is
    redisplayed with the Edit Manual
    Adjustment section at the top.
3.  In the Edit Manual
    Adjustment section, click Add
    New. A new adjustment row appears.
4.  In the Name column, enter a
    name for the adjustment.
5.  In the Type column, select the
    type of adjustment:
    - Absolute – Changes the forecast by adding or subtracting the value
      you enter.
    - Relative – Changes the forecast based on the percentage that you
      enter.
    - Replace – Changes the actual forecast value (number of
      impressions) with the value you enter.
    - Ceiling – Creates an impressions cap over a period of time, above
      and beyond 's spike detection and mitigation.
6.  In the Start and End columns,
    enter the start and end dates for the adjustment as needed.
7.  In the Daily Amount column,
    enter the number of daily impressions the product should receive. If
    you
    selected Absolute or Relative for
    the adjustment type, you can enter a negative number using the minus
    sign (-). 
8.  In the Status column, specify
    the adjustment's status:
    - Active – The change takes effect on the dates you selected.
    - Inactive – The change doesn't take effect until you edit the
      adjustment to make it active.
9.  (Optional) Click Preview
    Changes to see the adjustment applied in the Capacity
    Forecast area, as the Modified Manual Adjusted Forecast (Unsaved
    Changes) line. The original forecast is still displayed in blue.
    Child products affected by the adjustment appear in the Affected
    Rate Card Products list below the forecast.
10. Make any additional changes as needed to the adjustment, and
    then click Save. The manual
    adjustment line turns orange, and the original forecast line stays
    blue.

The changes to the forecast are only reflected in the Forecast
Management area. They are not reflected in other parts of yield
analytics or in the actual placement of ads until the system processes
data overnight.
