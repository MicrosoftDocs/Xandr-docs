# Microsoft Invest - Supported creative macros

We have creative macros that can be used for all, mobile, and video impressions. We also support privacy and function macros.

> [!NOTE]
> Creative macros are case-sensitive and aren't available for piggyback conversion pixels.

## Creative macros for all impressions

The following macros can be used for all impressions:

| Macro | Description |
|---|---|
| `${CLICK_URL}` | The click tracking URL. For Example: `https://xandr.com` |
| `${CLICK_URL_ENC}` | The encoded click tracking URL (only necessary for some third-party ad servers). For Example: `https%3A%2F%2Fxandr`.com |

The following macros can be used in creative third-party tags and landing page URLs:

| Macro | Description |
|---|---|
| `${ADV_CODE}` | The code of the advertiser to which the creative belongs. |
| `${ADV_FREQ}` | The total number of impressions seen by a user across all advertiser campaigns. |
| `${ADV_ID}` | The ID of the advertiser to which the creative belongs. |
| `${AGE}` | The age of the user if available. Supported values are an integer or 0. |
| `${APPNEXUS_AUCTION_ID}` | This macro is an alias for `${AUCTION_ID}`, and behaves in the same manner. |
| `${AUCTION_ID}` | The 64-bit character string representing the individual auction that led to the impression. |
| `${BID_PRICE}` | The first price bid for this impression, as opposed to the price paid after price reduction. |
| `${BIDPRICE}` | This macro is an alias for `${BID_PRICE}`, and behaves in the same manner. |
| `${CACHEBUSTER}` | A random number string used to limit caching of the URL. <br><br> **Note**: This macro ensures that a fresh call is made to the ad server every time the tag is called to accurately count all impressions. If you don't add this macro to the tag, you may see inaccurate impression totals. |
| `${CP_CODE}` | The campaign code of the served impression. |
| `${CP_ID}` | The campaign or split ID of the served impression. |
| `${CPG_CODE}` | The line item code of the served impression. |
| `${CPG_ID}` | The line item ID of the served impression. |
| `${CREATIVE_CODE}` | The code of the creative served if available. |

## Privacy Macros

In order for our clients to meet their transparency, notice, and choice/consent requirements under US state privacy law, the GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive, Microsoft Advertising supports the [Global Privacy Platform](https://iabtechlab.com/gpp) and the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework (the "Framework"). For more information, see the [IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework](https://iabeurope.eu/knowledgehub/policy/transparency-consent-framework-publishers-factsheet/). Publishers should reference [Part of Privacy Regulations](../policies-regulations/index.yml) when using macros, such as the ones noted in the table below, to surface notice, transparency, and choice to end users located in the EEA, signal approved vendors, and pass consent to Microsoft Advertising and demand sources as well as their vendors through the Microsoft Advertising Platform. For more information, see [Part of Service Policies](../policies-regulations/index.yml).

| Macro | Description |
|---|---|
| `${GDPR_APPLIES}` | Designates whether GDPR regulations are applied. It specifically indicates whether the user is located in a GDPR impacted country, or if we have a GDPR-required signal passed with the request. Possible values include: <br> - `0` for no <br> - `1` for yes <br><br> **Note**: `0` may be received from an EEA country. It is the publisher's choice to signal in this manner. |
| `${GDPR}` | This is an alias for `${GDPR_APPLIES}`, and behaves in the same manner. |
| `${GDPR_CONSENT_STRING}` | This macro specifies the IAB GDPR consent string. If the GDPR applies, it will contain a list of user-approved vendors based on the IAB GDPR Transparency and Consent Framework. For more information, see [IAB GDPR Transparency and Consent Framework](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework). |
| `${GDPR_CONSENT}` | This macro is an alias for `${GDPR_CONSENT_STRING}`, and behaves in the same manner. |
| `${XANDR_DOMAIN}` | Dynamically retrieves the appropriate Microsoft Advertising domain based on the cookie consent settings included in the TCF string. If the user has cookies enabled from their browser settings but has: <br> - not given consent for their cookies to be included in the TCF string, the `adnxs-simple.com` domain will be used to prevent the browser from attaching cookies to subsequent ad calls. <br> - given consent for their cookies to be included in the TCF string, the `adnxs.com` domain will be used to pass cookies in the header of each ad call. <br><br> **Note**: This macro should only be used if you plan on serving impressions in countries that require consent for cookies. |
| `${GPP_SID}` | Designates whether a section (i.e. regulatory framework) of the [Global Privacy Platform](https://iabtechlab.com/gpp) should be applied. Specifically, it indicates whether the user is located in a country affected by legislation covered by the GPP. |
| `${GPP_STRING_XXXXX*}` | This is the IAB [Global Privacy Platform](https://iabtechlab.com/gpp) (GPP) string. If a section of the GPP applies, then this will contain framework-dependent information reflecting the consent elections of the user. <br><br> **Note**: * XXXXX can represent any numerical id. |

## Function macros

A function macro performs a function on another macro. Function macros can be used in combination with any other creative macro, including custom macros. If they are not recognized at render time, they will not be translated and the function will not be called.

Microsoft Advertising currently supports the `{$URL_ENC}` function macro, which can be used for a variety of purposes related to encoding. A key use case is when a URL needs to be passed from ad server to ad server using a creative macro. Due to the presence of unsupported characters in standard URL formatting, the `{$URL_ENC}` function macro must be encoded at various stages of the process.

This function macro takes the following form:

``` pre
${URL_ENC(${MACRO_NAME},#)}
```

`${MACRO_NAME}` is the macro to be encoded and `#` is the integer representing the number of times to encode the contents. Possible values include:

- `1`
- `2`
- `3`

Each encoding corresponds to a step in the redirect chain, as well as how a given third-party click tracker works with the macro. Double encoding will usually be needed for final destination URLs when a second ad server is involved, and triple encoding for a third ad server.

To determine whether you will need to use single, double, or triple encoding, you should check with your third-party click tracker and then test your `URL_ENC` macro to ensure it works. If your macro is not working, one consequence of this may be link breakage, which will result in users not reaching the intended destination URL.

| Encoding Example | Format |
|---|---|
| Encoding click URLs once | Use the following format: <br> `${URL_ENC(${CLICK_URL},1)}` <br><br> **Note**: If `https://xandr.com` is passed as the click URL, using `${URL_ENC(${CLICK_URL},1)}` to single encode the URL would result in `https%3A%2F%2Fxandr.com` populating the creative. |
| Encoding media URL once | Use the following format: <br> `${URL_ENC(${MEDIA_URL},1)}` |
| Encoding media URL twice | Use the following format: <br> `${URL_ENC(${MEDIA_URL},2)}` |
| Encoding a custom macro called ADFORMAT once | Use the following format: <br> `${URL_ENC(#{ADFORMAT},1)}` |
