# Using alternative products to solve pricing/availability issues

Alternative products are available in Evaluate Orders to help resolve ! Price and ! Avails flags.

## About alternate products

The Score for an alternate product indicates how closely it's related to the order line's product, based on the following criteria:

- Alternate sizes – Products with the same targeting as the order line's product, but with a different value for Size.
- Audience affinity – Products that heavily overlap the same set of other products.
- Purchase behavior – Products that frequently appear together on the same orders.

## View alternate products

In the Product Details panel, click the **Alternate Products** tab.

## Add an alternate product to a proposal

1. Click the **Add** button to the left of the product's name. A new order line with the selected product is created at the top of the **Order Line Listing** above the **Product Details**.
1. Enter or change the order line parameters (e.g., Start date, End date, Imps) as needed.
1. Click **Update**.

To remove the order line, click **Edit** and clear the **Included** checkbox.
