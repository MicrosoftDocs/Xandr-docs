# Xandr Direct for Buyers



This page explains what Xandr Direct is and
other helpful details for using it.

Xandr Direct offers inventory that we believe
represents the most direct path to supply. This inventory is brought to
you directly through the Xandr SSP technology,
and is formed at its core from our direct-to-publisher supply most
frequently requested and purchased by our buyers across all formats
(display, mobile, video, and native).

Our mission is to provide a safe, high-quality, and easy-to-access
marketplace so buyers can purchase inventory with fewer intermediaries
taking fees (or adding hops) between the buyer and the inventory owner.
This mission of most-direct path to supply is why we have named this
offering Xandr Direct.



## The Purpose of Xandr Direct

With Xandr Direct, we are able to streamline the
process by which both Xandr and our partners
manage access to supply. Just as you can currently target all the
inventory at a particular SSP - and then place domains in allowlists or
blocklists across those SSPs - we are providing an easy way to target
Xandr supply that is frequently requested and
purchased by buyers, rather than requiring buyers to target each
individual seller. This also avoids buyers having to remember the
qualities of each and every seller when creating allowlists.

Xandr Direct provides the most direct path to
supply in order to:

- Lower your cost of media (with fewer intermediaries taking a cut of
  the transaction)
- Improve performance metrics (through lower latency and more direct
  access)
- Ensure a more transparent environment (by requiring confirmation that
  ad units are provided directly by the owners of the inventory or
  exclusive representatives)

You can find the full list of the growing and regularly-updated
marketplace of sellers available through Xandr
Direct, including many of the largest publishers available on
Xandr, in the **Partner Center** -- look for
"Xandr Direct" under the
**Seller Group** column. See
<a href="partner-center-screen-buyer-view.md" class="xref">Partner
Center Screen</a> for more information.





## Seller Selection Criteria

A number of factors go into determining if a seller is eligible for
Xandr Direct, including whether the seller owns
and operates the inventory they sell, the sellerâ€™s relationship to the
inventory, and the quality, size, geographic location, and format of the
inventory. Xandr reserves discretion over who is
included in Xandr Direct.

Xandr Direct includes all inventory formats made
available on the Xandr platform by the included
sellers. Xandr Direct is updated regularly with
newly-onboarded inventory sources for which both of the following are
true:

1.  The significant majority (\>75%) of a member's traffic is the most
    direct path to supply as determined by the following factors:
    - The media is owned and operated (O&O) by the seller, and we are
      integrated with the member with a tag on page (including header
      bidding, server-of-record relationships, and direct tag in the
      publisher's ad server) or through a direct server-side
      integration.
    - Alternately, the seller has an exclusive relationship with the
      publisher for access to a subset of inventory via a tag on page.
      The only way to get access to this inventory on
      Xandr is through the seller.
2.  We believe there is a low risk of invalid/fraudulent traffic because
    of the following:
    - We complete an audit of the inventory using our Inventory Quality
      technology to review for adherence to our policies (e.g., no
      pornography, nudity, hate speech) and require confirmation that
      the inventory is both valid and properly represented.
    - We require confirmation of the owner of the inventory, even if
      that inventory is available through an intermediary, along with
      confirmation that the media owner has approved the network to
      exclusively resell its inventory.





## Accessing Xandr Direct

You can target "Xandr Direct" on a
line item as you would target any seller on
Xandr. Buyers can block individual sellers from
Xandr Direct for a specific
line item via the seller "Exclude" feature or
all at once via Partner Center.

Any line item targeting
Xandr Direct today will show reporting for each
individual seller.
