# Real time data integration instructions

Although the configuration is slightly different from regular bidders that are actually purchasing media, data providers with real time
integrations are set up as "bidders" in our system. Once your data provider bidder has been created and you've received credentials, you
can begin configuring it with the below steps.

## Implement the Impression Bus API

Complete the following steps to begin using the Impression Bus API (api.adnxs.com):

**Step 1:** Use your API credentials to [authenticate](../bidders/authentication-service.md).

**Step 2:** You must set your ACL settings so as to accept Xandr's impression bus IP ranges. Make sure to allow IP ranges from the datacenters where you are listening to traffic and exclusively allowlist impression bus IPs (contact your Xandr Account Manager for a list of Xandr-specific ACLs). Remember to allow both NYM1 and NYM2 IP ranges if you are in the NY datacenter and to allow AMS3 and FRA1 IP ranges if you are in the AMS datacenter.

**Step 3:** [Create your parent profile through the API Bidder Profile Service](../bidders/legacy-bidder-profile-service.md). The profile will allow you to pre-filter traffic by parameters such as country, seller, and overall percentage. For testing purposes, it is recommended that you set the `passthrough_percent` field to something small like 5% until you are ready to take in a larger amount. Data provider bidders cannot have child profiles, they can only have a single parent profile.

**Step 4:** Configure your bidder by setting the `bid_uri` (endpoint for bid requests), `ready_uri` (endpoint for ready requests), and `parent_profile_id` fields. The `parent_profile_id` should be the ID of the profile you created in step 3. The other bidder object fields (`notify_uri`, `pixel_uri`, `click_uri`, etc) should not be set as they do not apply to data providers.

- Ensure that you include at least one of our macros in your `bid_uri`. For a complete list of available macros, see Xandr [Macros for Data Providers](xandr-macros-for-data-providers.md).

**Step 5:** Add at least one bidder instance. In production, at least one bidder instance must be registered with each datacenter for which you would like to see traffic.

**Step 6:** Create segments using the [Segment Service](../digital-platform-api/segment-service.md). The `code` field is what you will return in your bid response. You may also create segments in our [Bidder UI](https://bidder.xandr.com/login) on the Segments tab.

> [!NOTE]
> You may only create segments in your own member's seat.

**Step 7:** Begin responding to ready requests with a 1 and to bid requests with segment codes. If you cannot respond within 8-10ms or do
not have any segments for a given impression, respond with a new line:

- Ready requests: Respond with `'1\n'`
- Bid requests: Respond with `'segmentCode1\nsegmentCode2\n' or '\n'`

> [!TIP]
> As a guiding principle your bidder should seek to approach a 0% timeout rate. To achieve this it is very important that your bidder respond to ALL bid requests (with codes or with a new line) within approximately 7 milliseconds to account for jitter.

**Step 8:** Confirm that your integration is working correctly by looking at metrics in our [Bidder UI](https://bidder.xandr.com/login).

**Step 9:** Share your segments with clients using the [Member Data Sharing Service](member-data-sharing-service.md).

**Step 10:** Ongoing: Monitor your metrics in the [Bidder UI](https://bidder.xandr.com/login) on the Metrics tab.

## Other considerations

- Given the required response time of 10ms or less, real time data providers should consider co-locating within data centers used by Xandr to reduce latency and ensure the response times are 10ms or less.
- Real Time Data Provider integration usually takes multiple months to complete. We encourage prospective data providers to take that into account before starting integration with Xandr.
