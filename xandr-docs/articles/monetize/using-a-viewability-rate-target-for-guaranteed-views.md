# Using a Viewability Rate Target for Guaranteed Views



Because a vCPM campaign may still incur some impression-based costs, it
may be necessary to manage the average viewability rate. Because a vCPM
campaign only pays media cost on viewable impressions, a typical
threshold for a CPM campaign (e.g. 70%) will be too high. To manage the
risk of very low viewability while still taking advantage of the
viewable-only payment feature of the vCPM campaign, use a lower
threshold (e.g. 30%).
