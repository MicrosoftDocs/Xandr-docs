- [Negotiate Deals with Sellers](negotiate-deals-with-sellers.md): If you don't find packages that meet your needs, kick off negotiations for one-off deals with sellers.

Use the links below to learn more and get started.

- [Manage Your Deals with Sellers](manage-your-deals-with-sellers.md): Use the Deals screen to view the details of all your existing deals, monitor each deal's health, and trigger detailed reports.
- [Control Your Deals with Sellers](control-your-deals-with-sellers.md): Use the Deals screen to control deals received from sellers.
