# Reports Overview



The Reports tab provides access to a
flexible analytics engine that supports both recurring and ad hoc
inventory and yield analysis. Yield Analytics Reports integrate data
from multiple sources to provide a centralized view of your business.

Because the Reports tab includes
inventory forecast and order line allocation data, it provides not only
historical analysis but predictive analytics as well. In addition,
because the data structures take into account inventory overlaps, all
analysis can be performed at the network-level as well as against a
specific inventory set.
