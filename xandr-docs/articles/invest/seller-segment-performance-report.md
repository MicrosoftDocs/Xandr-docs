# Microsoft Invest - Seller segment performance report

The **Seller Segment Performance Report** provides sellers insights into how their targeted segments are contributing to the overall performance of their line items. The report provides data on all targeted segments (includes and excludes) that contributed towards transacted impressions.

This reporting helps sellers in the following ways:

- by providing data on the usage per segment, so they can understand how often they used each segment and thus enable them to bill their data providers and/or advertisers appropriately
- by providing data of performance per segment, so they can analyze which segments are performing well or not well and optimize appropriately
- facilitating data clearing, so that instead of them being responsible for billing their data providers each month, Xandr can do it for them.

## To run your report

Follow these steps to run your report.

1. Select **Reporting** from the appropriate top menu (depending on how your account has been configured).
    1. Or, from the Publishers top menu, click on **Prebid Server Premium** > **Analytics** > **Prebid Server Analytics**

1. Select the relevant report from the list. The **Report** screen shows the available filters, dimensions, and delivery options for the report. The selections you make here will determine what report data is delivered to you, and how.
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > For an explanation of how grouping and filtering work, see [Dimensions, Metrics, Filtering, and Grouping](./dimensions-metrics-filtering-and-grouping.md).

1. Select the relevant filters to limit the data displayed to just the information you want. For example, rather than running a report that shows impressions for all inventory sources, you may want to list results for just a select few. When you select a filter (by clicking **Edit**), a selection panel appears. Select items in the **Available** list (left), then click **Add** to include them in the **Chosen** list (right).

1. Group by Dimension. Grouping allows you to display rows of data in the order you prefer.
    > [!WARNING]
    > The more dimensions you group by, the larger the data set that is returned. Larger data sets can take substantially longer to process. Be sure to group using only the dimensions you need.

1. Choose a delivery option. Once you've selected your filters and grouped by your chosen dimensions, you need to choose a delivery method. Available delivery methods include:

    - **Run now, show results in screen**: For smaller amounts of data, you may want to view the report as soon as possible in your browser.

    - **Run in background, notify me when results are ready to view**: A popup notification will let you know when the report is ready to view or download.

If the size of the report is more than that, you can try to download it using the [API](../digital-platform-api/report-service.md) for that reporting service (The limit here is 10 million rows).
