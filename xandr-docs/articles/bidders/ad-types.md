# Ad types

Clicking the **Ad Types** tab accesses a screen where you can select which ad types you want to receive. By default, all ad types are included: Banner, Video, Native, and Audio. You can remove specific ad types by **unchecking** the appropriate box. Ad types are sometimes removed to receive specific types of inventory. (Example: Video and Audio).

## Banner sizes

- When targeting **Banner** ad type, you can make additional granular ad size targeting.
- Selecting **Specific Sizes** accesses a menu where **Standard** sizes are shown in the left-hand column for you to select. When selected, they are moved to the **Selected** column to the right.
- You can also add in custom sizes on the bottom of the screen by entering in the **Width** and **Height**, and clicking the **Add Size** button.

When you close the Ad Types tab, a summary is shown in the upper right-hand corner of the Ad Types display bar that shows that you've applied some sort of targeting. *(Example: Audio, Native, and Video Included).*

> [!NOTE]
> **Ad Types** and **Supply Types** are the only two targeting options that by default show some sort of targeting summary in the upper right-hand corner of their display bars.
