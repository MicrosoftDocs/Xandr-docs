# Set Reserve Prices on Android

<div class="body">

The reserve price is the minimum bid amount you'll accept to show an ad.
This setting should be used with caution, as it can cause you to show
significantly fewer ads (or none at all), which will negatively affect
your app's monetization.

<span class="notetitle">Note:</span> This API must be called
