> [!IMPORTANT]
> Trader Home is currently available to a limited set of clients.

**Trader Home** displays a card for every insertion order that you have added to your **Trader Home** page, showing you essential metrics about the insertion order. The cards
also provide quick access to insertion order details, as well as its child line items.

## Getting to trader home

**Trader Home** displays when you log in. To reach the **Trader Home** page after you've navigated to other locations, click the logo in the top left corner.

## Viewing your trader home totals

**Trader Home** provides totals that offer quick insights into your overall impact.

These statistics include:

- **Total Budget**: Sum of your insertion order lifetime budgets in **Trader Home**.
- **Yesterday Spend**: Total amount of money you spent yesterday (between 00:00:00 to 23:59:59 UTC).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Totals display in the member's default currency.

## Viewing insertion order details

To view advanced details about an insertion order, click the insertion order's name. See [View Insertion Order Details](view-insertion-order-details.md) for more information.

## Viewing insertion order metrics

Each card displays metrics to help you assess the status of your insertion orders. The insertion order card provides easy access to the pacing health of your insertion order and what is needed to successfully deliver.

There are three important metrics presented on each card:

- **Yesterday Spend** - Amount of your budget you spent yesterday (between 00:00:00 to 23:59:59 UTC).
- **Current Daily Needed** - Amount of spend needed daily (including today) for the rest of the flight in order to stay on pace.
- **Pacing at** - Percentage determined by comparing Yesterday's Spend to how much daily spend is needed for the rest of the flight (Current Daily Needed).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These metrics display in the insertion order's currency or in impressions, depending on how the insertion order's budget was configured.

## Viewing the performance chart

Each card displays a performance chart that tracks the insertion order's **Average CPA/CPC** and **Daily CPA/CPC** as of yesterday.

> [!TIP]
> You can view specific details down to the day by hovering over the graph to show the exact CPA or CPC for that date.

## Viewing flight dates

The card displays the number of **Days Left in Flight** for the insertion order. The units of time remaining in the flight will switch to hours when there are 48 hours or less left.

The flight must be added to the insertion order for the card to display all of the metrics. For information on how to add a flight, see [Create an Insertion Order](create-an-insertion-order.md).

## Viewing card states

The color of each card will change according to the status of the insertion order:

- **Red** - Warning: **Pacing at** value is less than 90% or greater than 150%.
- **Black** - Normal: **Pacing at** value is between 90% and 150%.
- **Blue** - Note: More insertion order information is needed to display full pacing data.

Each card falls into one of the nine states outlined in the table below.
