# Explore Line Items





The Line Items screen shows you
essential metrics about all line items under a specific advertiser,
informs you of conditions preventing line items from serving, provides
quick access to each insertion order's details and child campaigns, and
offers bulk editing and reporting options.

For publishers, the Line Items screen is where you'll go to manage
demand from your direct-sold advertisers, including standard and
guaranteed delivery line items.



Things you can do on this page include:

- Use filters to quickly identify line items with specific criteria
- See delivery and performance metrics
- See important line item details and make changes quickly



Get to the Line Items Screen

To get to the line items screen:

- Select
  Advertisers
   \>  Line Items from
  the navigation menu at the top of the screen.

  or

- From the Advertisers screen, find
  the advertiser whose line items you want to see and click the button
  in the **Line Items** column

Publisher users can:

- Select Orders
   \>  Line Items from
  the navigation menu at the top of the screen.

  or

- Click All Line Items in the left
  panel on the Line Items or Orders screens.

Filter your Line Items

The column next to the line item's name (on the left) contains an icon
that shows the current eligibility of that line item to serve. Possible
eligibility icons include:



<table class="table">
<thead class="thead">
<tr class="header row">
<th id="ID-00000eb9__entry__1" class="entry">Icon Type</th>
<th id="ID-00000eb9__entry__2" class="entry">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody class="tbody">
<tr class="odd row">
<td class="entry" headers="ID-00000eb9__entry__1">Play</td>
<td class="entry" headers="ID-00000eb9__entry__2">The line item's
campaigns are running smoothly.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even row">
<td class="entry" headers="ID-00000eb9__entry__1">Pause</td>
<td class="entry" headers="ID-00000eb9__entry__2">Campaigns under the
line item are inactive. Hover over</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd row">
<td class="entry" headers="ID-00000eb9__entry__1">Warning</td>
<td class="entry" headers="ID-00000eb9__entry__2">There are issues with
the line item or its campaigns that are keeping it from serving.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even row">
<td class="entry" headers="ID-00000eb9__entry__1">Pause/Warning</td>
<td class="entry" headers="ID-00000eb9__entry__2">Campaigns under the
line item are inactive, and there are issues with the line item or its
campaigns.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



Hover your mouse over the icon for details about that line item's state.
Allowed states are:

- **Play** - Line items with the "play" icon are eligible to serve.
- **Paused** - Line items with the "paused" icon are ineligible to serve
  due to conditions that are likely intentional and user-driven. When a
  line item shows this status, hover over the icon to see exactly what
  conditions are preventing it from serving. The following conditions
  can provoke this status:
  - State is set to inactive.
  - Flight start is in the future.
  - Flight end is in the past.
  - Lifetime impression budget has been met.
  - Lifetime revenue budget has been met.
  - Daily impression budget has been met.
  - Daily revenue budget has been met.
  - All campaigns under this line item are inactive.

Search by Name/ID

You can use the search field at the top of the screen to find all line
items whose names or IDs include a specific string of characters or
numbers.

Find Inactive Line Items

Line items with the **Inactive** state are shown with their IDs, names,
and quickstats in gray italics.

View Line Item Details

To view a summary of details about a line item, just click the line
item's name. To see a full, detailed summary and a graphical view of
delivery and performance, click the graph icon that appears when you
hover over the line item (it's next to the pencil).

For more information about line item details, see
<a href="view-line-item-details.md" class="xref">View Line Item
Details</a>.

View Quickstats

The metrics on the Line Items screen
help you quickly assess the performance and delivery of your line items.
Known as "quickstats", these metrics are faster and more readily
accessed than standard reporting data. Quickstats are cached on a
regular basis and are shown whenever you open the Line Items screen.

Note that Quickstats may not match the data from standard reporting
exactly for technical reasons. For more information, see
<a href="availability-of-reporting-data.md" class="xref">Availability
of Reporting Data</a>.



<b>Tip:</b> To sort your line items by any
given quickstat, click on the column name, e.g., **Profit**.



Intervals

Use the drop-down at the top right of the screen to choose the interval
for quickstats. Available intervals include:

- **Today** Current calendar day up to the last hour.
- **Yesterday** Full 24-hour period of the previous calendar day.
- **Last 7 Days** Full 7 days previous to the current calendar day,
  i.e., excluding today.
- **Lifetime** Entire lifetime of each line item, including the current
  calendar day.

Columns

The following quickstats are shown for each line item. Note that the
data always reflects the currently selected quickstats interval:

To get information about attributed conversions, rather than just
conversion pixel loads as shown in the
**Convs** column, see
<a href="reporting-on-conversions.md" class="xref">Reporting on
Conversions</a>.

Show/Hide Columns

You can choose the columns that are displayed by clicking the
Configure Columns button on the upper
right.

This opens the **Configure Columns** dialog. From there you can select
or deselect the columns you wish to display using the checkboxes. Click
OK when you are done making your
selections to return to the Line Items
screen.

Show/Hide Pacing Bars

For line items that meet certain requirements (see below),
Microsoft Monetize helps you visualize how well the
line items are pacing to their budgets for the selected quickstats
interval. When you turn the Pacing toggle on, the Imps or Revenue
quickstat, depending on the type of budget set for the campaign, is
transformed into a pacing bar.



<b>Important:</b>

It is important to note that pacing bars, like all other quickstats,
reflect the currently selected quickstats interval, and for each
quickstats interval, there are specific requirements for pacing to be
calculated. See below for more details.





<b>Important:</b>

For guaranteed line items with a **vCPVM** revenue type, the information
displayed in the pacing bars is not based on viewable impressions yet,
but we're working on it. For now, you can surface delivered viewed
impressions in the grid by:

1.  Clicking the grid edit button next the
    Export to CSV button
2.  Checking the **Viewable Imps** checkbox in the dialog that appears

For more information about viewability, see our
<a href="introduction-to-viewability.md" class="xref">Introduction to
Viewability</a>.



Understanding Pacing Bars



Each pacing bar tells you the following. Note that for a line item with
a revenue budget, the pacing bar will show revenue rather than
impressions.

- The pacing bar shows **how much of the line item budget has been
  spent.**
- The bold black number that appears across the pacing bar shows **the
  number of impressions or amount of dollar spend that has actually
  occurred for the line item.**
- The gray number below the pacing bar shows **the lifetime budget, in
  impressions or currency.**
- The blue line represents how much of your budget you should have
  spent: **lifetime budget/total number of days in the flight x actual
  number of days in the flight.**
- The percent shows how closely your line item is pacing according to
  even daily pacing: **actual budget spent/how much of your budget you
  should have spent.**



The exact requirements for calculating pacing depend on the quickstats
interval selected, the type of budget set, and whether or not there's a
flight end date. For each quickstats interval, the requirements are as
follows:



<table class="table">
<thead class="thead">
<tr class="header row">
<th id="ID-00000eb9__entry__57" class="entry">Quickstats Interval</th>
<th id="ID-00000eb9__entry__58" class="entry">Requirements</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody class="tbody">
<tr class="odd row">
<td class="entry" headers="ID-00000eb9__entry__57">Lifetime</td>
<td class="entry" headers="ID-00000eb9__entry__58">Lifetime Budget and
Flight End Date</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



Report on Line Items

You can initiate a report for one or more line items directly from this
screen. Check the box for each line item that you want to report on and
click Actions
 \>  Run Report. This
takes you to the
<a href="advertiser-analytics-report.md" class="xref">Advertiser
Analytics Report</a>, where the line items you selected are set as
filters. For further information about running the report, see
<a href="advertiser-reporting.md" class="xref">Advertiser
Reporting</a>.

Activate/Deactivate Line Items

You can activate or deactivate one or more line items directly from the
Line Items screen. Check the box next
to each line item that you want to activate or deactivate and click
Actions 
\>  Activate or
Actions 
\>  Deactivate.

When you deactivate a line item, the line item will typically stop
serving within 10 - 15 seconds, with a maximum wait time of
approximately 60 seconds.
