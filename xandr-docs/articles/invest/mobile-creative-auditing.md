# Mobile Creative Auditing



Depending upon the type of mobile creative that you're attempting to
serve on the Xandr platform, the audit process
may vary. To ensure that your mobile creatives are successfully audited,
you should adhere to our audit processes for mobile creatives.


## App Download Campaigns

To correctly audit creatives that promote app downloads, we have created
several sensitive attributes, which include **Mobile App Downloads** and
**Ringtones/Mobile Subscriptions**. Both of these categories can be seen
in the creative trafficking workflow within the
Creative Quality pane.




## Mobile Landing Pages



In order for a mobile creative with a deep link or mobile-specific
landing page (opening an app or click-to-call) to pass our audit, you
must provide an alternative landing page URL in the
Brand URL field in the
Creative Quality pane.



<b>Note:</b> This URL should be a closely
related landing page that is visible from a desktop browser. We strongly
recommend that you verify if the landing page is visible from a desktop
browser before submitting the creative for audit. You can add this in
the Creative Quality pane of the
creative trafficking workflow.






## MRAID Creatives



<a
href="https://www.iab.com/guidelines/mobile-rich-media-ad-interface-definitions-mraid"
class="xref" target="_blank">MRAID</a> is a framework that allows rich
media creatives to be displayed from within mobile apps.



<b>Warning:</b> If your mobile creative has a
mobile-specific targeted landing page, such as a click-to-call creative,
you must provide an alternative landing page URL in the
Brand URL field of the trafficking
workflow. This URL should be a closely related landing page that is
visible from a desktop browser. We strongly recommend that you verify
that the landing page is visible from a desktop browser before
submitting the creative for audit. For more information about how you
can serve MRAID creatives on your mobile inventory, see
<a href="run-rich-media-creatives-on-mobile-inventory.md"
class="xref">Run Rich Media Creatives on Mobile Inventory</a>.





To successfully pass our platform audit, all MRAID creatives must always
display the appropriate branding from a desktop browser even when a
mraid.js file isn't present. The Xandr Audit
team will verify that the MRAID creative contains the appropriate
branding, but they will not flag any unusual or unexpected behavior
since MRAID creatives may exhibit behavior that is incompatible with
desktop browsers.



## Unbranded Creatives

Many mobile supply partners are willing to accept creatives that do not
show a brand in the creative image. To accommodate this, we added a
**Sensitive Attribute Unbranded Creative (mobile only)**. As long as a
creative is clearly a mobile creative (submitted with a Brand URL or as
MRAID), an auditor can pass an unbranded creative with this flag. The
brand must be implied by the creative, and the landing page should
contain proper branding. Creatives will still have to click through to a
branded landing page in order to have a brand associated with them. This
will allow mobile creatives that do not have a brand in the creative
image to still be associated with a brand in our systems.

The **Unbranded Creative (mobile only)** sensitive category will be
enabled by default in all ad quality profiles. This will not affect web
supply. For mobile supply, many sellers approve unbranded creatives, so
this change will be in line with their policies.



## Targeted Creatives



<b>Warning:</b>



Before uploading targeted creatives, you must provide your
representative with the following information for our internal audit
team:

- Creative IDs
- Your targeting criteria with common targets grouped together to
  facilitate an audit



**We highly recommend that you verify if you can view targeted creatives
by manually overriding your web browser's User-Agent.**



Auditing targeted creatives is a best effort service. If the creatives
are targeted to anything more specific than a mobile OS, your creative
will probably not be auditable. For example, you can target Android, but
not Android version 2.3 specifically.
