## Programatic Guaranteed (PG) Workflow

![Trade Desk Buying Guide Fig R](media/trade-desk-buying-guide-fig-r.png)





## Tips & Tricks for PG Workflow

- For PG deals with **GAM**, **Magnite**, **Freewheel**, or
  Bidswitch, the client will utilize
  the Easy Proposal Activation workflow described above.
- If the SSP is not **GAM**, **Magnite**, **Freewheel**, or
  Bidswitch, the publisher will
  provide the client with the targetable deal ID so the client can
  create the PG contract in The Trade Desk platform.



<b>Note:</b>

A few best practices for clients:

- Make sure to leverage the The Trade Desk’s PG workflow on the
  platform.
- Ensure that there are no daily spend caps on the Ad Group or Campaign
  level.
- Confirm that the Ad Groups are in active state.
- Make sure that the agreed ad sizes are trafficked at the Ad Group
  level.
- Make it certain that all parties are aligned on the budget. Ensure
  that the client’s creative meets the specs outline by the publisher
  and that the creative is uploaded 24-48 hours before the launch date.

<li>Our buyers are self-service and will make the decision as to when/if
they activate their campaigns against certain supply types.</li>
<li>We encourage the publishers’ sales team to share the deal private
contract links with any clients you are contacting. The link will drive
buyers with logins to our platform closer to the point of spend
activation on the Third Party PMP Library deals. Please note that you
will not be able to view the links, but our clients should have
access.</li>
<li>You may see more adoption in client First Party 1:1 deals after
setting up Third Party PMP Library deals. The 1:1 deals will likely
drive more revenue, but we see value in the PMP Library deals since they
allow newer and smaller agencies to access your inventory.</li>
