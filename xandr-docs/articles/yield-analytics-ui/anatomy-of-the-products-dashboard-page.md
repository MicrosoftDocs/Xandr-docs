# Anatomy of the Products Dashboard Page



The Products Dashboard page is the
primary view for the Product tab. It
provides a summary of:

- Products at risk of under-delivering
- Products with the best consumption
- Product performance across products



<b>Tip:</b> From any of the pages within the
Products tab, you can click a product
to see its full details on the Product Visibility page.




## About the Products Dashboard Interface

The Products Dashboard page consists of the following three widgets:

- Revenue Against Goal – Displays revenue against goal for the most
  at-risk products across your network or within a specific parent
  product (e.g., 160x600). You can change the parent product and time
  period in this widget.
- Top Direct Consumed Products – Displays consumed impressions for the
  top-performing products across your network or within a specific
  parent product (e.g., 160x600). This is calculated based on direct and
  contained consumption. You can change the parent product and time
  period in this widget.
- Product Performance – Displays performance totals across your network,
  or performance by product within a specific product group. You can
  change the product group and time period in this widget.

To the left of the widgets is the Products Tasks panel, where you can
select between four main options for working with products:

- Find Products – This accesses the Find Products page. This is where
  you can see see a list of the products across your network, and filter
  that list based on any number of targeting attributes.
- Analyze Overlaps – This accesses the Audience Planner page. This is
  where you can analyze how the audience overlaps between your
  products. 
- Create a Product – This accesses the Product Creation page. This is
  where you can create new products based on attributes of existing
  products and/or a custom set of attributes.
- Organize Products – This accesses the Product Groups Admin page. This
  is where you can organize products into groups for easier attribute
  management and cross-product reporting/analysis.

The Product Tasks panel is a read-only summary panel that shows totals
for the products included in yield analytics's capacity forecasts.
