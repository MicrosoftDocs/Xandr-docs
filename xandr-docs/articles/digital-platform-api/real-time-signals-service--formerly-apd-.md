# Real-time signals service (formerly APD)

> [!WARNING]
>
> - The Real-Time Signals Service is in Beta, and is subject to change in the future.
> - As we transition to open beta, **we will be adding a monthly charge for new and existing clients that use RTSS**. For more information, speak to your account manager.

The following guide is meant to help users create segments using the Real-Time Signals Service (RTSS). RTSS enables segment creation and
targeting based on real-time signals such as open location codes, URLs, or IP addresses. It is a scalable, consentless alternative to cookie-based audience targeting.

RTSS is especially valuable under the following conditions:

- **GDPR and the Demise of Third-Party Cookies.** With tightening privacy regulations and increased scrutiny around user data collection, in addition to ad-blocking, reliance on cookies and other device IDs will become increasingly difficult in the foreseeable future.
- **CTV and the Cookie-less Environment.** There is no universal or persistent standard for device identification for CTV. The CTV ecosystem is dominated by a handful of "walled gardens." As a result, advertisers and their agencies must work directly with each and every device maker/platform, or buy through PMP.

By providing unique targeting capabilities in a cookie-less environment, along with supply from the Xandr exchange, RTSS can be a key
differentiator for buying, selling, and curation:

- **Publishers:** For publishers and their DMPs, RTSS provides a viable alternative to onboard/monetize their 1P audience based off contextual signals, in a secure, privacy compliant way.
- **Curators:** For curators, RTSS enables them to create context-based audiences using alternative signals. They can then pair these unique audience data with supply from the Xandr exchange to create media products and then sold through deals to any DSP.
- **Buyers:** For buyers, RTSS enable them to create their own or access to premium publishers' audiences and target in cookie-less environment, such as CTV.

## RTSS support

If you encounter problems or need guidance while using RTSS, please open a case in the [Xandr support portal](https://help.xandr.com/). To provide feedback on the beta, feel free to reach out to your account management team.

## Bugs and breaking changes

- Beta status means that we release and update features frequently in response to the feedback we receive from participants in the beta program. You can expect to experience a few hiccups, and your team should have a strategy that takes into account occasional issues with the platform.
- Our standard [Breaking Change](breaking-changes.md) notification policies and timelines also do not apply to this beta feature. Make sure you monitor all communication from Xandr in regard to this beta, and be prepared to modify your implementations to accommodate changes.
