# July 14, 2021: New Targeting Enhancements



We are introducing the ability to target postal code lists and deal
lists at the line item and split level. From our **Location Manager**,
you can easily create postal code lists by grouping various postal codes
together into one list at the member level. From our **Inventory menu**,
you can easily create deal lists by grouping various deal IDs together
into one list at the member and advertiser level.
