# Microsoft Invest - Cross-Device targeting and measurement

Cross-device targeting and measurement, which can be enabled at the line item level, ties together events or actions for a unique individual that occur on different devices.

By tracking and managing each individual user's ad viewing and conversion experience across the various devices they use, advertisers can deliver a holistic brand experience to consumers and more accurately measure the impact of ad spending on driving conversions.

Cross-device capability enhances targeting and attribution using information from an identity graph, a database of customer information that allows Xandr to identify users on multiple devices. Supported identity graphs are:

- Xandr's identity graph, which covers the United States and Europe. The Xandr United States and Europe graphs are powered by market-leading data partners.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > European cross device coverage is currently limited to the following key countries:
