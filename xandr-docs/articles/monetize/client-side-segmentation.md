# Client-Side Segmentation



The most common way of building audience segments is by placing
client-side segment pixels on websites or creatives, signaling that a
user has visited a web page or taken a simple action. If you're new to
audience targeting or if you have relatively simple audience targeting
strategies, then this method is probably the one that you'll want to
use.

Use Cases

- **Performance / retargeting campaigns**. As users browse the Internet,
  they visit sites that move them along the attribution funnel (or a
  series of interactions that elicit a desired action from the user,
  such as a page visit, conversion, etc.) You, as a buyer, might set up
  several ad campaigns each targeting a particular segment that
  corresponds to a section of the attribution funnel. Users are added to
  these segments as they visit different pages relevant to the
  acquisition event (such as visiting the home page, adding items to a
  shopping cart page, a purchase confirmation page, etc.)
- **Brand awareness campaigns**. If you're a buyer or seller, and are
  looking to do basic clustering or modeling of audiences, you can also
  use client-side segment pixels. In this instance, the purpose would be
  for branding, ultimately giving a signal that a user has visited a
  particular page or taken a specific action. While similar to the
  retargeting example above, in this situation, the goal is to bring
  brand awareness to the relevant audience rather than prompting a user
  response or action. An example of this is a "luxury car enthusiast"
  client-side segment pixel firing on a high end online magazine, where
  the audience would then be bought against by trading desks
  representing the branding efforts for BMW.
