# Microsoft Monetize Home page 

Microsoft Monetize Home page serves as the default landing page for all Microsoft Monetize customers. It provides a centralized experience through key modals such as SMW Line items and Insights, delivering actionable content to help customers stay informed and enabling them to take effective measures towards achieving their daily goals. 

Microsoft Monetize Home offers insights into business performance, key performance indicators (KPIs), and workflow shortcuts. Itâ€™s designed to support all stakeholders in efficiently navigating their daily tasks. 

## Navigating the Home page 
When you sign in to Microsoft Monetize, the Home page is displayed by default. It contains two primary sections: 
- Performance 
- For You

## Performance 

The **Performance** section displays a high-level view of revenue trends and fluctuations across multiple business capabilities. This section is powered by insights for Managed, Deals, Prebid Server Premium (PSP) server-side solutions, Open Exchange, and many more. 

To adjust the timeframe for the performance data, use the date range selector located at the top-right of the Performance section. The available options are: 
- Last 7 days 
- Last 28 days 
- Yesterday 

Within this section, you can see interactive cards that automatically rotate to reflect the most significant percentage changes in revenue. These changes may relate to top advertisers, buyers, publishers, or PSP server-side solutions. Each card is fully interactive: 
- Hover over any graph to view the delta in revenue changes. 
- Click on an entity, such as an advertiser under Managed, a buyer or publisher under Deals, or a top SSP change under PSP, to open the Insights app The Insights app provides deeper metrics and context for the selected entity.
