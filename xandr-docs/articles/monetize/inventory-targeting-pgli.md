# Inventory Targeting



You can target or exclude direct inventory as well as Universal and
Custom categories for Programmatic Guaranteed line items using the
Inventory Targeting settings.

You can target or exclude the following inventory:

- Universal Categories (for more detail, see below)
- Custom Categories (for more detail, see below)
- <a href="direct-inventory-targeting-ali.md" class="xref">Direct
  Inventory</a>

To target specific inventory, open the **Inventory & Brand Safety**
branch. Then click Edit next to
**Inventory**. Use these settings to limit the inventory your line item
will target.

Universal and Custom categories:

- **Universal:** Universal categories are defined by
  Xandr. When Xandr
  reviews inventory, we apply these categories based on the inventory's
  content. For example, a car dealership placement group would be
  assigned to the "Autos & Vehicles" category. Sellers can apply
  universal categories when self-reviewing inventory as well.
- **Custom:** Custom categories are defined by sellers. Sellers create
  these and apply them to slices of their inventory to package their
  inventory for specific buyers to target.

Target Universal Categories

By default, your line item will target all universal categories.
However, you can narrow your targeting to include or exclude specific
universal categories.

1.  On the Universal Categories tab,
    include or exclude custom categories.
    - The **Categories** lists shows all top-level universal categories
      defined by Xandr. You can either include
      or exclude top-level categories or drill into a category to view
      its child categories.
    - The **Sub-Categories** list shows all child universal categories
      in the context of their parent categories. You can either include
      or exclude sub-categories. Note that when you exclude a top-level
      category, its sub-categories are not available for further
      inclusion or exclusion.

    

    <b>Note:</b> When targeting more than one
    universal category, the categories have an OR relationship. For
    example, if you target the "News" and "Finance" categories, you will
    bid on inventory that is in either category. The inventory does not
    need to be in both categories.

    
2.  Click Add.

Target Custom Categories

By default, your line item will target all custom categories. However,
you can narrow targeting to include or exclude specific custom
categories that you have applied to your own placement groups and/or
placements for direct buying as well as custom categories that other
sellers have exposed to you for third-party buying.

1.  On the Custom Categories tab,
    include or exclude custom categories.
    

    <b>Important:</b> When targeting more than
    one custom category, the categories have an OR relationship. For
    example, if you include "Custom Category 1" and "Custom Category 2",
    you will bid on inventory that is in either category. The inventory
    does not need to be in both categories.

    
2.  Click Add.
