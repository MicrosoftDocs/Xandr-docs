You must target users based on at least one geographic element such as
country, region, city, metro code, or postal code. You may optionally
set up other geographic inclusions or exclusions.

If you have set up third-party buying filters, only inventory in
countries listed in both your third-party buying filters and line item
geography target settings will be targeted. If you target (include)
geographies at the region, city, metro code, or postal code level,
Xandr will use these settings to derive the
country target to be compared with your third-party buying filters.

To set up line item geography targeting:





1.  From the
    Audience & Location Targeting
    section, click in the Geography
    field and select the applicable checkboxes for country-level
    targeting.
2.  Click +Additional
    Geo Restrictions to set up or import additional geographical
    restrictions if necessary.
