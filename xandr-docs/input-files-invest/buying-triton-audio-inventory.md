# Buying Triton Audio Inventory



This page provides specific information for the **Triton Audio Ad
Exchange**, which includes testing your ads and setting up a
line item to target **Triton** audio inventory.



<b>Note:</b> If you are interested in serving
companion banner ads, please contact your Xandr
or Triton representative.



Test Your Ads

After designing your audio creative and adding your creative to
Xandr, you can test it. (See
<a href="buying-audio-inventory.md" class="xref"
title="You can buy audio inventory on Xandr using our optimized buy-side workflow.">Buying
Audio Inventory</a>.)

Triton Digital has created a test station where you can test your
a2x/Xandr ads in a replica of a live
environment. The test station runs a sequence of one song followed by
one or more ads. You can test only one ad at a time.



<b>Note:</b> To access the test station, a
**custom placement ID** and a **player site ID** from Triton Digital is
required. To obtain these IDs, contact Triton Digital customer support.



To set up and listen to a test ad:

1.  Upload your ad using the **Creative Manager** and assign it to the
    **Alpha Test** brand in the Creative
    Attributes section, using the **Self-classify** audit option.
2.  Create a new line item. In the **Buying
    Strategies** area of the Basic
    Setup section, set the **Bid a base CPM** to $1.00 CPM.
    

    <b>Note:</b> These impressions will not be
    charged since this is a testing platform.

    
3.  In the Targeting section, select
    Inventory
    \>  3rd Party Inventory
    targeting and enter your custom placement ID using the **text**
    mode.
4.  Click Include and then **Add**.
5.  Go to the following URL:
    <a href="https://player.listenlive.co/xxxx" class="xref"
    target="_blank">https://player.listenlive.co/xxxx</a>, where xxxx is
    the site ID provided by Triton Digital.

After setting up your line item, you can target
all Triton inventory or specific categories of Triton inventory.

In the Targeting section under
Inventory, click
Edit. This opens the **Inventory
Targeting** dialog.

In the **Inventory Targeting** dialog, under
3rd Party
Inventory  \>  Sellers,
search for "Triton". Include the seller called **Triton Digital** by
clicking on the green checkmark icon.

Target specific categories of Triton audio inventory

Alternatively, you can narrow the inventory to specific formats. Click
Triton **Digital** in the **Sellers**
view to see a list of all the categories.You are now in the **Publishers
and Categories** view. Select the format categories you want to include.

You can narrow the inventory type by excluding categories such as ad
type, asset type etc. You can also exclude categories that you don't
want instead of including categories that you do.

Ad Type Categories: Preroll or Midroll

If you want to play only preroll ads, exclude the midroll category.

To specify a preroll line item:

1.  In the inventory list for Triton Digital, search for **Midroll**.
2.  Click the minus icon to exclude the **Midroll** category.

Device Categories

Using inventory targeting, you can narrow the scope of your
line item to include or exclude device
categories. The available device categories are listed below.

<thead class="thead">
<tr class="header row">
<th id="ID-00007576__entry__1" class="entry">Category</th>

the uncategorized category if you want access to the full scale of
inventory for mobile devices.
</td>

You can also narrow the inventory by specifying if the inventory should
target players that use cookies, or those that do not. The available
cookie categories are listed below.

<table class="table">
<thead class="thead">
<tr class="header row">
<th id="ID-00007576__entry__13" class="entry">Category</th>
<th id="ID-00007576__entry__14" class="entry">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody class="tbody">
<tr class="odd row">
<td class="entry" headers="ID-00007576__entry__13">Cookie: Matched
(924163)</td>
<td class="entry" headers="ID-00007576__entry__14">Inventory that is
assigned to traffic from users who are matched to an ID from <span
class="ph">Xandr using the Xandr
cookie.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even row">
<td class="entry" headers="ID-00007576__entry__13">Cookie: Not Synced
(24164)</td>
<td class="entry" headers="ID-00007576__entry__14">Inventory that is
assigned to traffic from users who are not synced with an ID from <span
class="ph">Xandr, either because the player does not support
cookies or because the player does not have the cookie sync code.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



<b>Note:</b> There are no controls to keep you
from narrowing your scope to a point of excluding all inventory. For
example, you can choose to exclude **Category: Mobile Browser** in a
line item with a scope of "Mobile:
Device-Optimized websites". This will leave you with no available
inventory. Make sure to use prudence when targeting categories.
