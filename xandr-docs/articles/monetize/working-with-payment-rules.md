# Working with Payment Rules



Payment Rules represent a financial agreement between a network and a
publisher. A network may have a single payment rule for all impressions
from a publisher, or it might have a **base rule** that serves as a
default. More specific **conditional rules** can be defined that apply
to individual impressions based on geography, frequency, or other
targeting.
