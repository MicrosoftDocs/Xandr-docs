# Microsoft Invest - Cross-Device reporting

Reporting on cross-device targeting and measurement is available in the Member Analytics report, the Device Analytics report, and the Data Usage report, as well as on the **Analytics** tab for the augmented line item.

> [!NOTE]
> Cross-Device Metrics on the Line Item Analytics tab includes data for the last 60 days only.

## Reports with Cross-Device metrics
