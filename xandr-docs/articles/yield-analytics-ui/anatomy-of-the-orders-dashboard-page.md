# Anatomy of the Orders Dashboard Page



The Orders Dashboard page is the primary view for
the Orders tab. This provides a
summary of revenue against goal, consumed impressions, and how orders
are performing. It is displayed automatically when you click
the Orders tab.


## About the Orders Dashboard Interface

The Orders Dashboard is comprised of the following three widgets:

- Revenue Against Goal – Displays the difference between earned revenue
  and scheduled revenue in absolute terms for each order, order line, or
  advertiser for the selected date range. Click an order or order line
  to open a detailed view at the order's performance, as well as its
  order lines' consumption and competition.
- Consumed Impressions – Displays a pie chart of the percentage of
  consumed impressions by order, order line, or advertiser for the
  specified date range.
- Order performance – Displays multiple performance metrics filtered by
  order or order line, for the selected date range (the default is for
  the previous day). You can click on a specific order or order line to
  open a detailed view at the order's performance, as well as its order
  lines' consumption and competition.

For each widget, you can:

- Click Reset to reset the widget.
- Click View All to run the related
  full report (e.g., Saved Analysis - Impressions At Risk) in
  the Reports tab.

To the left of the widgets is the Orders Tasks panel, which contains
links to find orders and order lines, and to Evaluate Orders.

- Find Orders – Takes you to the Find Orders page. This is where you can
  search for an order, view its details, and add it to a scenario.
- Find Order Lines – Takes you to the Find Order Lines page. This is
  where you can search for an order line, view its details, and add it
  to a scenario.
- Evaluate Orders – Takes you to the Evaluate Orders Search page. This
  is where you can begin the process of analyzing potential yield.

The Orders Tasks panel is the Processing Summary panel. This is a
read-only panel that shows the number of orders and order lines for
which yield analytics is forecasting delivery, as well as when the
delivery forecast was last updated.
