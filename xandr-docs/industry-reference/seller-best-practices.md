# Seller best practices

This table documents some best practices for Microsoft Monetize sellers to maximize revenue and optimize their monetization strategies.

| Best Practice | Recommendations  | Benefits |
|---|---|---|
| Provide all SSP partners with equal access to available ad units and sizes through header bidding. | - Limit your supply paths to five SSP partners.<br> - Limit your wrapper integrations to no more than two. | - Leveraging too many SSPs can ultimately slow down the auction and won’t offer unique demand.<br> - Improve supply path optimization by reducing redundant competition in the wrapper. |
| Integrate all SSP partners equally. | Pass all parameters needed for an optimal auction in every integration:<br> - Price Floors<br> - User IDs (LiveRamp IdentityLink, Unified ID 2.0, etc.)<br> - Banner-specific parameters (Position, Size, API)<br> - Video-specific parameters (Mimes, Min/Max Duration, Protocols, Size, and API)<br> - App-specific parameters (Device & App Info)<br> - Privacy (GDPR, CCPA, COPPA, DNT, LMT)<br>Ensure a consistent number of bid requests per partner (ex. All Multi-size, or all not). | - Passing comprehensive information about your inventory and users to DSPs helps bidders make more strategic purchasing decisions.<br> - Consistently including the same fields across SSPs helps buyers determine the most efficient paths, which typically results in higher yield for sellers. |
| - Ensure all SSP partners are passing price floors in a consistent manner. | **For clients using Prebid.js**:<br> - Update to the latest version of Prebid.js and implement the price floor module. This will enable Microsoft Monetize to pass net floors defined in the Price Floors Module.<br> **For non-Prebid integrations**:<br> - Ensure that you are passing consistent net price floors for your inventory to each supply partner, including Microsoft Monetize. | - Defining your net price floors in Prebid enables all of your Prebid adapters supporting the module to pass through a consistent set of price floors. This reduces the operational burden of managing price floors individually with each of your SSP partners.<br> - By passing its net floor to Microsoft Monetize, the platform includes any applicable fees and sends the corresponding gross floor price (i.e., the minimum CPM including network margin) to bidders. This ensures that buyers only submit bids that meet or exceed the gross threshold, guaranteeing that the publisher’s net floor is respected. |
| Use of standardized placement formats. | Avoid using multi-format ad requests for placements that support both display and video. Some buyers do not bid on multi-format requests, which can reduce demand and limit yield. Instead, configure separate ad requests for display and video to ensure you capture the full demand from each format.   | - Send separate ad requests to maximize monetization opportunities.<br> - Many DSPs do not allow for multiple formats in a single request. Due to capacity constraints, they will typically respond to the request for one format, limiting the available overall demand. |
| Routinely update your Prebid.js integration. | Frequently update your Prebid.js integration to capture changes Microsoft Monetize makes to our Prebid adapter and alleviate any potential errors with demand partners.<br> - Engineering teams should follow the Prebid.js Releases GitHub project to view recent release notes.  | - Microsoft Monetize makes periodic updates to Prebid Server Premium so you have the best opportunity to monetize your ad requests.<br> - Adapter updates impact the way bidders and buyers receive publisher requests, and the only way to ensure these updates are captured is by updating Prebid.js.<br> - Updating Prebid.js is generally a quick and straightforward process and is an easy way to reduce errors with demand partners and improve monetization. |
| Support and pass a Global Placement Identifier (GPID). | - Implement a Global Placement Identifier (GPID) into your ad requests to support DSP supply path optimization efforts.<br> - To support the GPID, simply update to the latest version of Prebid.js and include the GPT Pre-Auction module. | - DSPs are laser-focused on improving supply path optimization to reduce infrastructure costs and ensure they are not receiving multiple bid requests for the same inventory.<br> - To streamline spend paths and reduce duplicate requests, DSPs are asking publishers to implement a GPID to better track suppliers sending ad requests to multiple SSPs.<br> - Proactively supporting and passing a GPID ensures that you don’t miss out on current or future DSP spend as DSPs begin to enforce restrictions to optimize yield. |
| Ensure price floor parity across your tech stack. | - Establish consistent price floors for the same inventory in all systems (i.e. ad server unified pricing rules, line item CPMs, deal prices, SSP floors, etc.).<br> - If you make a change to price floor in your ad server, you will need to make the same change in Microsoft Monetize by following the [Create a Floor Rule](../monetize/create-a-floor-rule.md) instructions or notifying Account Management.<br> - Floor prices set for buyers should be net your revenue share in your ad server (i.e. if you set a $16.00 floor in your ad server and you have a 20% revenue share with Microsoft Monetize, your Microsoft Monetize price floor should be $20.00). | - Price floors can be applied and enforced in a variety of places throughout your tech stack.<br> - Establishing consistent prices floors minimizes bidder errors and improves bidder decisioning by eliminating ambiguity.|
