# Reports as Pivot Table



If you are familiar with using pivot tables, you'll find yield
analytics Reporting easy to use. Both systems essentially work the same.

Below is a visual that describes how yield analytics builds out reports:

## Report Filter

Metric Filters define what data is important within that underlying
dataset. This is equivalent to Report Filter.





## Row Labels

Dimensions define how you divide your data. This is equivalent to Row
Labels.

Additional Dimensions divides the data in a more more granular way than
Dimensions does. This is equivalent of adding multiple Row Labels.





## Column Labels

Using the Group By feature in yield analytics Reports (Configuration
Section) is the equivalent of moving a dimension to the Column Label
section in a pivot table. This produces the same data as before, but
organized into columns instead of rows.





## Values

Metrics define what data is aggregated by your dimensions. This is
equivalent to Values.

Additional Metrics add additional data fields. This is equivalent of
adding multiple Values.
