# Microsoft Monetize - Impression funnel

The Impression Funnel provides detailed line item metric information in the form of graphs and charts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Microsoft Monetize Monitoring feature is in **Open Beta** and currently only supports deal line items, augmented line items (ALI), and guaranteed delivery augmented line items (GDALI). It is subject to change without notice and is only available to select clients.

The **Impression Funnel** is available in the **Troubleshooting** window. For more information, see [Troubleshoot Line Items](troubleshoot-line-items.md). You can use the Impression Funnel to:

- View impressions matched, bids, bid requests, auctions won, and impressions rendered to understand the line itemâ€™s health.
- Monitor associated rates to keep track of line item performance, including: bid request rate, bid rate, win rate, and render rate.
- Learn recommended seller actions to manually remedy line item issues as well as buyer actions to suggest directly to the buyer.

The Impression Funnel includes the following settings and metrics:

- **Buyers** - the buyers associated with the line item. Click the edit icon to change buyers. For more information, see [Set Up Multi-Buyer Deals](set-up-multi-buyer-deals.md).
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > Selecting a buyer filters the Impression Funnel issues and suggested actions to that specific buyer.
