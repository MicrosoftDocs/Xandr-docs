# Freewheel priority values in Yield Analytics

To appropriately rank competing FreeWheel placements, yield analytics maps numerical values to FreeWheel priority values.

## Freewheel summary

Yield Analytics assigns priority values for FreeWheel order lines as follows:

- The highest priority ads are the sponsorship ads that additionally have five levels of prioritization.
- Next in priority are guaranteed ads with set priorities from 20 to 11, with 20 being highest precedence.  
- Next in priority are the typical ads that have no priority setting, but compete based on the CPM value of the placement. The more revenue, the higher the rank.
- The lowest priority are negative values, which indicate lower priority (i.e., non-guaranteed ads, with -10 as the lowest).

## Priority mapping table

The following mappings are based on FreeWheel's values for Contract type and Override, and are displayed in decreasing order of rank. These values will be available across the yield analytics UI, including availability lookups and reports.
