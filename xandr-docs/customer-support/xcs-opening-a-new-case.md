# Opening a new case

Log in to the [Customer Support Portal](https://help.xandr.com) to access your full case history, knowledge base articles, or request support.

You also have the option to continue as a guest, without logging in, but you will have limited access to knowledge base articles and attachments.

Before you open a case, you may want to double-check that the contact information in [your profile](xcs-updating-my-profile.md) is accurate.

To open a new case, log in to the [Customer Support Portal](https://help.xandr.com) and click **Contact Support** on the right side of the page.

## Step 1: Select a category

Select the category that best describes the case:

- **Bell DSP** - Questions regarding Bell DSP.

- **Product Support** - Technical support queries, or questions about how to use features.
- **Client Finance** - General Billing requests, or questions around Credit, or Collections.
- **Other** - Questions that don't fit the other categories.

## Step 2: Select an issue

Select an issue from the **Topics** drop down menu which best suits your case.

## Step 3: Set the severity

Set the severity of the case:

- This is minor.
- This is major, but I have a workaround.
- This is major, and I am blocked.
- This is an outage, wake everyone up! (only available if you select "Product Support").

Selecting **This is an outage, wake everyone up!** will page the on-call support team to respond to your request immediately. Ensure that your request requires immediate attention if you select this option.

An outage occurs when an essential production feature is broken with no viable workaround. Examples include:

- Severe loss of ad serving or severe ad serving latency.
- UI is not accessible or consistent API timeouts.
- Reporting is not accessible or reports are delayed for over six hours.

## Step 4: Add a subject and description

Enter a brief summary of the case in the subject field and a detailed account in the description field.

For the summary, be concise but specific. For example, "UI latency" is more helpful than "UI not working". When you press **Enter** or **tab** away from the **Subject** field, the list of suggested articles to the right is automatically updated based on the terms you've entered. If none of the suggestions are helpful and you need to submit a request, a more precise subject line helps you and the support team easily identify the case.

In the description, try to include all the information necessary to reproduce the problem. Typically, this includes:

- A description of the issue.
- A summary of the impact on your immediate goals.
- Steps to reproduce the issue, including test pages and URLs.
- All relevant object IDs.
- The UI environment (if applicable).
- The browser and operating system affected, including version numbers (if applicable).

## Step 5: Add cc addresses (optional)

You can add up to ten email addresses to be cc'd on case updates. These users will be emailed the case details and any new comments added to the case. Ensure that the email addresses are correct, separated by "," and that everyone you've cc'd would like to receive updates. You can update the cc addresses after the case is opened or request that an agent do so.

If anyone you've cc'd on a case would like a portal account, they can visit the [Login](https://help.xandr.com) page, proceed as a Guest, and click **Contact Support**.

## Step 6: Select a Member ID (optional)

Select the **Member ID** related to your request from the drop down menu.

## Step 7: Add an Invoice Number (optional when Client Finance is selected)

If you selected **Client Finance**, provide the Invoice Number related to your request.

## Step 8: Add attachments (optional)

Click **Upload File** or drag and drop your file in the attachment section to attach files that will help reproduce or troubleshoot the case, for example, an error log, a creative that's causing problems, a report that has helpful results, or a screenshot of the screen that's not displaying properly.

An on-call team will respond immediately for outages. For non-emergency cases, Customer Support will respond within 24 hours, and typically much faster. For more information about response times and support processes, see [Client Services](xcs-xandr-client-services.md).
