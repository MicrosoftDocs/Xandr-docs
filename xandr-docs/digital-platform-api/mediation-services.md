 Microsoft Monetize Ad Server mediation enables demand from sources that aren't integrated with the Monetize exchange or [Prebid Server Premium](../monetize/prebid-server-premium.md) to compete for publisher inventory. This includes both established partners like Google and custom networks. For additional information on mediation, see [Selling Your Inventory through Mediation](../monetize/mediation-selling-your-inventory-through-mediation.md).
