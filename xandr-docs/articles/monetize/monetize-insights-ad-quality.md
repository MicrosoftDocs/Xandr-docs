# Ad Quality







<b>Note:</b> This feature is part of a
functionality that is currently in **Beta**. It is still under
development and may be subject to change without notice. Contact your
Xandr Account Representative to get enabled.





Ad Quality shows revenue-impacting
blocks to help identify and evaluate opportunities to adjust ad quality
settings. They are settings that the publisher has for brand safety. It
gets configured when the client joins our platform and then may not be
re-evaluated frequently. In the Ad
Quality tab:

- Creative Preview lives directly
  in the side panel for quick review.
- there are direct links to rule management settings.


<b>Note:</b> As an organization, we recommend
you to regularly view your Ad Quality settings (at least quarterly) to
make sure that are appropriate and consistent with settings configured
in the other SSPs (that you may also be using to monetize inventory).
Generally, the blocked bid value overestimates potential revenue impact
and is influenced by the price and frequency of the bids that have been
blocked.





<b>Note:</b> If an Ad Quality (AQ) is set as
`default_brand_status:banned` but the parent brand is set as
`status:trusted`, the child brand overrides the setting in
`default_brand_status` and it will be able to serve unless it is
explicitly banned in the Ad Profile's brand override list.









## Ad Quality Summary

The value mentioned on Ad Quality tab
is the blocked bid value. A $5.8M of blocked bid value in last 7 days,
up 11% compared to prior week does not provide a direct revenue number
but can be used directionally to assess opportunities.
