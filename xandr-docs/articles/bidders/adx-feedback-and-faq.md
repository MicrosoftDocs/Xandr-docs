# AdX feedback and FAQ

We strictly adhere to the guidelines and restrictions of the Google Ad Manager platform, all of which can be found at the links below.

  "The audio portion of your video ad will be played when a user clicks on your ad" and "The video portion of your video ad will be played when a user clicks the image, URL, or the play button. The video will not automatically replay; the user must click the play button to initiate a replay."
