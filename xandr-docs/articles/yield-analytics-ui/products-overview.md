# Products Overview



From the Products tab in
yield analytics, you can:

- View a summary of product performance across your network
- Analyze how products overlap each other
- Create new products
- Edit existing products
- Organize products into groups for easier product management

**About Products**

Products are used to represent inventory within a structure that carries
pricing and/or reporting metadata. The default targeting attributes for
your products are determined by your ad server implementation. You can
view and edit these attributes in yield analytics.



<b>Tip:</b> Yield Analytics maintains
a continuous history across all previous versions of a product's
targeting.



**Product Types**

Products are divided into four types:

- Rate Card –  Product that is sold frequently by the sales team and
  represents the product catalog (e.g., ROS 728x90). 
- Reporting – Product that is used for reporting purposes, but is not
  generally not sold (e.g., Top three ad sizes in the Sports section). 
- Custom – Product that represents a unique combination of attributes -
  that is not typically sold - but may have been trafficked in the ad
  server (e.g., ROS 728x90, DMA=NY, LA). Unique products referenced by
  order lines in the ad server are imported into yield analytics as
  custom products. 
- Seasonal Model – Set of products that represents the seasonal patterns
  of traffic on your site. The full set of seasonal model products must
  comprehensively account for all the impressions in your network.
  Seasonal model products cannot overlap each other, and each seasonal
  model product must reflect all the distinct seasonality patterns
  observed in your network. 

**Product Statuses**

The status of a product determines the data that's available for it in
yield analytics - as follows.

- Active – Historical data is collected and forecasting is made for
  future performance.
- Inactive – Historical data is preserved, but no forecasting is
  available.
- Pending – Forecasting can be made for future performance, but no
  historical data is collected. Pending products that are not referenced
  by an order line and/or are not converted to Active status expire from
  yield analytics after a specific period of time.

The status of a product is determined by the product type and how the
product was created.
