# Target Inventory on the Microsoft Advertising Exchange





Note: This form of targeting is only
available to Standard Line Items. For an overview of which targeting
options are available to Standard versus Augmented Line items, see
<a href="buy-side-targeting.html" class="xref">Buy-Side Targeting</a>.



This page shows you how to target a campaign to run on Microsoft
Advertising Exchange inventory using Xandr
Monetize. You can target:

- All Microsoft Advertising web inventory
- Specific Microsoft Advertising "bins" for MSN inventory
- Specific domains for Microsoft Advertising web inventory in Denmark,
  Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Spain, Austria, Switzerland, India
  and South-East Asia

Outlook.com, see

Microsoft Outlook.com Inventory</a>.



Step 1. Open your campaign

On the Campaigns screen, select the campaign that you want to run on
Microsoft Advertising inventory and click the
Edit icon.

This will open the Edit Campaign
screen.

Step 2. Confirm the buying strategy

Microsoft Advertising is an external supply partner. Therefore, in the
Basic Settings section under
Buying Strategies, you should be sure
to select Buy Third-Party Inventory
and set a strategy. For detailed information about the strategies open
to you, see
<a href="buying-strategies.html" class="xref">Buying Strategies</a>.

Step 3. Turn off inventory quality filtering

Under **Inventory Quality**, the default settings allow only
platform-reviewed inventory. Since some Microsoft Advertising inventory
might not be platform-reviewed, the surest way to reach all the
Microsoft Advertising inventory that you want to target is to allow your
campaign to service on any inventory.

To do this, under Inventory Quality,
select the **Serve on any inventory** radio button.

Step 4. Confirm that Universal Categories and Custom Categories are not
targeted

(Note that this only applies to non Microsoft Ads in Apps Inventory.)

Microsoft Advertising inventory cannot be targeted based on content
category by most buyers. If you target any particular category, you will
be excluding Microsoft Advertising inventory. Therefore, you should make
sure that your campaign allows all categories.

Under Inventory, click the Edit button
to open the **Inventory Targeting** dialog, then click
Universal Categories and make sure it
is set to **Any Universal Category** and **Custom Categories** is set to
**Any Custom Category**.

Step 5. Target Microsoft Advertising Inventory

If you target all third-party inventory, your targeting will include all
Microsoft Advertising inventory. However, if you want to focus on
Microsoft Advertising, you **must** set more specific targets. This step
walks you through the following options:

  class="xref">Option 1. Target all Microsoft Advertising web
  inventory</a>
- <a

  class="xref">Option 2. Target specific Microsoft Advertising MSN
  "bins"</a>

  class="xref">Option 3. Target specific domains for Microsoft Advertising
  web inventory in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Spain,
  Austria, Switzerland, India and South-East Asia</a>

Option 1. Target all Microsoft Advertising web inventory

In the **Inventory Targeting** dialog, under
3rd Party Inventory \> **Sellers**,
search for "Microsoft Advertising Exchange" seller. Include the seller
**"Microsoft Advertising Exchange (280)"** by clicking on the green
checkmark icon.

Option 2. Target specific Microsoft Advertising MSN "bins"

To target specific Microsoft Advertising bins, follow the steps in
**Option 1**, and then click on "Seller: Microsoft Advertising Exchange
(280)" to expose a list of bins - named "Content Categories" on the
Xandr platform. You can then either **Include**
the specific bins that you want to target or
Exclude the specific bins that you do
not want to target.



Important: For a complete list of MS Ad
Exchange bins with descriptions, see
<a href="microsoft-advertising-exchange-inventory.html"
class="xref">Microsoft Advertising Exchange Inventory</a>.





Tip: **Targeting Microsoft Advertising
and Other Third-Party Inventory**

- If you want to target specific Microsoft Advertising bins and **all**
  other third-party inventory, the best method is to **Exclude** the
  specific Microsoft Advertising Exchange bins that you do not want to
  target (shown below).
- If you want to target specific Microsoft Advertising bins and **some**
  other third-party inventory, the best method is to **Include** the
  specific Microsoft Advertising Exchange bins you want to target and
  **Include** other inventory at the **Seller** or
  Custom Categories level.



Option 3. Target specific domains for Microsoft Advertising web
inventory in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Spain, Austria,
Switzerland, India and South-East Asia

To target these domains, under
Targeting in the
Inventory Targeting section, click the
Edit button. This opens the
**Inventory Targeting** dialog. Select
Specific Domains, enter the domains
you want to target, click the Add Domains button, then use the
**Include** or Exclude buttons as
appropriate.

Step 6. Set additional targeting options

In the Targeting section, you can
target users based on geography, segment, frequency, daypart, system,
page properties, and demographics. In general, demographic and tag
targeting are not recommended when targeting Microsoft Advertising, as
they could inadvertently restrict your reach. For more information, see
<a href="buy-side-targeting.html" class="xref">Buy-Side Targeting</a>.



Important:

**Combining Inventory Bin Targeting and Geography Targeting**

Bins concern the location of the inventory, whereas geography targeting
concerns the location of the user, based on information from the user's
browser. For example, if you target a bin for Canadian inventory, and
you target users in the Unites States, your campaign will serve only to
US users who happen to be looking at that Canadian inventory.



Step 7. Review and save your campaign

Once you have finished adjusting your campaign targeting, confirm that
the details are correct and then click the
Save button to save your changes.
