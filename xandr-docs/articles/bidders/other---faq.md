## Data Providers

**Do you work with data providers?**

Yes, we work with several data providers, including contextual and
behavioral. Please reach out to your Xandr representative if you would
like to work with data providers on the platform.

**How does the data from a data provider come in the bid request?**

The bid request includes the segments for the impression. Both
contextual and behavioral data providers have segments that correspond
to relevant data. These segments will be sent in the bid request.




## Requests and Responses

**What is the click_request and click_response?**

The <a

Xandr to help track clicks. This is primarily useful to our bidder
clients that have built their bidders on the Xandr framework. If you are
interested in using the click request and response, please reach out to
your technical and account contacts.




## Sample Code

APIs in any language.




## Selling Inventory

**Can I sell inventory through Xandr?**

Selling requires a separate contract. If you are interested in selling
inventory, please reach out to your account contact.




## Partner Inventory vs. Platform Inventory

**What is the difference between partner and platform inventory?**

Partner inventory is comprised of impressions that come from other
exchanges, such as Google Ad Manager, Rubicon, AdMeld, etc. Platform
inventory is made up of impressions that are resold by networks
representing publishers.
