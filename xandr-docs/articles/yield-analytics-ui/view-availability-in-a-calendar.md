# View Availability in a Calendar



You can view daily availability in a calendar for a given month, to find
openings for new deals. This is especially useful for sponsorships.

To view the calendar:

1.  On the Availability Dashboard page, in the Availability Tasks panel,
    click View Calendar. The
    View Calendar page appears.
2.  In the Filter panel on the left side of the page, in
    the Configuration section, select
    how you want availability to be displayed:
    1.  In the Show Availability As list, choose to see availability as
        a percentage of available impressions or as the number of
        available impressions.
    2.  In the Availability Based On list, choose whether you want to
        see availability based on all order lines, or only order lines
        in sponsorship/exclusive campaigns.
    3.  In the Consumption Type list, choose whether you want to see
        availability based on consumption type (Contained, Direct,
        and Indirect).
    4.  On the Colors slider, determine the percentages you want to use
        to determine whether a date is available for booking. The
        calendar shows you at a glance the dates that meet these
        percentages as follows: Dates displayed in green are available
        for booking. Dates displayed in yellow have some inventory
        available for booking. Dates displayed in red are unavailable
        for booking.
3.  In the Filter panel on the left side of the page, in
    the Lookup Criteria section,
    select the product groups, products, and targeting you want to use
    for lookup. For example, you may want to choose a product group for
    sponsorships only and targeting for a particular demographic. As
    soon as you choose a product, the calendar view is populated
    accordingly and is refreshed automatically as you change your
    criteria (e.g., if you add targeting). By default, availability is
    displayed for the current month. You can change this using the month
    filter on the calendar toolbar. Mouse over a date to see a summary
    of availability. This includes capacity, availability, and
    sell-through information, as well as the number of booked, pending,
    and proposed order lines.
4.  To see the full details for a particular date, click that date on
    the calendar. The page is redisplayed in a table (also referred to
    as the list view) with the date you clicked expanded by default.
