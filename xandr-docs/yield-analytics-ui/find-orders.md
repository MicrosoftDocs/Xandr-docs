# Find orders

1. On the **Orders** tab, in the **Orders Tasks** panel, select **Find Orders**. A list of all of the current month's orders appears, filtered by default to show all orders except those that have been cancelled.
1. (Optional) Filter the orders list using the **Filter** panel:
    - To filter the orders list by date, select **This Month** in the **Date Range** filter, specify a standard or custom time period, and select **Update**.
    - To filter the order list by status, select **Includes x Values** in the **Status** filter, click on a status to select or deselect it, and select **Update**. The selected statuses are displayed in a tooltip.
1. In the search box in the toolbar above the order list, type a search term, change the search options as needed, and then press **Enter**. The order list is redisplayed to show only the orders that match your search criteria.

    - By default, the search returns orders that contain the search term you entered. To change the type of search, on the drop-down list to the left of the search box, select **Contains** and select a different option (e.g., to search for orders that starts with the search term you typed, select **Starts With**).
    - By default, the search is run against the advertiser, order name, order ID, order line, and order line ID. To narrow the search to just one of these, select **All** in the drop-down list to the right of the search box and select a different option (e.g., to search for orders by order name only, select **Order**).

> [!TIP]
> From within the order search results, you can:
>
> - View the details of an order – Select an order's name in the **Order** column to open the **Order Visibility** page.
> - Add an order to a scenario – To the left of the order, select **Add to Scenario** from the list that appears.
