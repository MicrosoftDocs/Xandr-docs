# Video players

This page describes the Microsoft Advertising video player offerings, as well as ideal use cases and limitations of each player.

## Instream versus outstream video

Instream video refers to video advertising for which publishers provide their own players (usually to house their own content).

Outstream video refers to video advertising that is dependent on a player provided as part of the video placement architecture which has zero footprint and expands as needed to host an ad on the page.

This page concerns the various player options we provide for outstream video (including outstream mediation) when players are not hosted by the publisher.
