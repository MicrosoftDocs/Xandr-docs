# Understanding multi-buyer deals

Multi-Buyer Deals provides sellers with two different ways to set up deals with multiple buyers.

Multi-buyer deals offer the following benefits to sellers:

- Sellers can set up a deal with multiple buyers. When sellers set up a deal, they can include a list of buyers rather than just one. Buyers encompass seats or members as well as entire DSPs. When a seller sets up a deal with eligible buyers on a DSP, they use the DSP’s bidder ID (not a proxy member ID of any kind).
- Sellers can edit the buyers on a deal. Once a seller configures a deal, they can edit who the buyers are over the course of a deal.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Some DSPs do not support changing the buyers once a deal has been registered on the DSP. Be sure to check with the buyer about what they support.

- Sellers can better understand how DSPs are configured to buy on deals. The **Buyer Targeting** screen (see [Set Up Multi-Buyer Deals](set-up-multi-buyer-deals.md)) indicates whether a DSP is bidding with seats or members and it will enforce settings around whether that DSP supports multi-buyer or bidder-level deals. Xandr enables DSPs on an individual basis to support either bidder-level (i.e., DSP-wide) or multi-buyer deals.

With multi-buyer deals, sellers can set up:

- Multi-buyer deals with multiple buyers (members or seats) across various DSPs. There’s no limit on the number of buyers that can be included on a deal.
- Bidder-level deals with all buyers in a multi-buyer enabled DSP.

For more information, see [Set Up Multi-Buyer Deals](set-up-multi-buyer-deals.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Each DSP has different levels of support for these features. A DSP might support both, only one, or neither of these options.
