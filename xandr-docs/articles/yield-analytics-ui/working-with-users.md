# Working With Users

During implementation, yield analytics sets up an initial set of
usernames, passwords, and user permissions.

After this initial setup, you can add, edit, disable, and delete user
accounts for your organization. (This is assuming you have
administrative permissions). 

You can then grant permissions to these users by adding them to the
appropriate user groups.
