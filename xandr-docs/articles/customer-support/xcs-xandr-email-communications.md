# Xandr Email Communications

Xandr sends periodic emails that we think you'll find useful, including Marketing Communications (event invitations, whitepapers), Product and Technical Communications (release notes, service updates), and Training Communications (webinars, live training sessions).

- If you have a Xandr user account, you should receive relevant communications automatically.
- If you do not have your own Xandr user account, you can contact your Xandr Account Representative.
- If you want to stop receiving Marketing or other communications, you can update your preferences [here](http://go.appnexus.com/UnsubscribePage.html).
