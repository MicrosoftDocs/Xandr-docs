Frequently Asked Questions about Microsoft Advertising Customer Support Portal

## Why is there a new Customer Support Portal?

In February, a new Customer Support Portal became available for opt-in. This updated version offers a more seamless experience across products.

## What happens after I start using the new Customer Support Portal?

Once you have signed into the new [Microsoft Advertising Customer Support Portal](https://support.ads.microsoft.com), the new portal provides a 12-month lookback of active cases.
> [!NOTE]
> The [legacy portal](https://help.xandr.com/) has been fully retired as of June 9th 2025. Please use the new [Microsoft Advertising Customer Support Portal](https://support.ads.microsoft.com) to create and track new cases going forward.

## How can I view cases created under a different email address?

You can access cases created under a different email address by creating a personal Microsoft account using the old email address. While we discourage using this email to create new cases, you can use it to view previous cases.
For example, if you logged into `help.xandr.com` with `ABC@email.com` but used `XYZ@email.com` for Microsoft Invest, create a personal Microsoft account with `ABC@email.com` as the username. Then, log into `support.ads.microsoft.com` using that account to view the old cases created under `ABC@email.com`. However, going forward, use `XYZ@email.com` to create new cases in the new [Microsoft Advertising Customer Support Portal](https://support.ads.microsoft.com).  

## Why do I see only some cases in the new Customer Support Portal?

> [!NOTE]
> The [legacy portal](https://help.xandr.com/) has been fully retired as of June 9th 2025. Please use the new [Microsoft Advertising Customer Support Portal](https://support.ads.microsoft.com) to create and track new cases going forward.

The new [Microsoft Advertising Customer Support Portal](https://support.ads.microsoft.com) displays cases from the [legacy portal](https://help.xandr.com/) with the following exceptions:

- Cases created before February 2024 do not appear.
- Closed cases do not appear.
- If missing cases fall under these exceptions, this behavior is expected. You can still view them in the read-only legacy portal at `help.xandr.com`.

## What happens to the “Proceed as Guest” option for creating cases?

The **Proceed as Guest** option is no longer available. To create a case, set up a personal Microsoft account and log in to the new Microsoft Advertising Customer Support Portal using that account. Once logged in, you can create a case through the portal.  

## Can I continue accessing the legacy portal?

The [legacy portal](https://help.xandr.com/) has been fully retired as of June 9th 2025. Please use the new [Microsoft Advertising Customer Support Portal](https://support.ads.microsoft.com) to create and track new cases going forward.


<!--
You can continue accessing the [legacy portal](https://help.xandr.com/) for the next few months. However, we recommend transitioning to the new [Microsoft Advertising Customer Support Portal](https://support.ads.microsoft.com) as soon as possible, as the legacy portal will be phased out and will no longer be available. If you have no active cases in the legacy portal, we strongly encourage using the new portal to create and track new cases.
