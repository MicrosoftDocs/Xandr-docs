# Microsoft Curate - Managing user logins and permissions

The pages mentioned in this section describe how to create and manage your users and set up their passwords and permissions.

With the consolidation of Microsoft Advertising to the Microsoft family, we have integrated the authentication process of the users (who are using Microsoft Advertising products) to the Microsoft Identity Platform. The profound advantage of this integration is that users would be able to access Microsoft Advertising applications using the same sign-on methods as for other Microsoft products. Additionally, the integration to the Microsoft Identity Platform enables new and more secure methods of authentication, powered by Microsoft.

For more details, visit [Microsoft Identity Platform Login](microsoft-identity-platform-login.md).
