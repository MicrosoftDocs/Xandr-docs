# Sample Bid Requests



The Bid Request Sampler provides
sample bid request data under certain time frames and conditions. You
can download results as a text file.

<div id="sample-bid-requests__prereq_hrz_mkf_hmb"

Note: The Xandr
Monetize Monitoring feature is in **Open Beta** and currently
only supports deal line items, augmented line items
(ALI), and guaranteed delivery augmented line items (GDALI). It
is subject to change without notice and is only available to select
clients.







<div class="li stepsection">

To sample bid request data:



1.   In Date,
    select the date and time in which you want to pull bid
    requests.
    

    

    Note: Bid requests are pulled
    within the previous 24 hours of the date and time you select. You
    can only select a date and time within the last 7 days.

    

    
2.  In Media
    Type, select either Any Media
    Type or a specific media type
    (Banner,
    Video,
    Native, or
    Audio).
3.  In Country,
    select either Any Country or
    Custom Country (use the
    Select Country drop-down to select
    a country from the list).
4.  In Number of Bid
    Request, select the number of bid requests you would like to
    pull.
    

    

    Note: Bid requests are limited to a
    maximum of 100.

    

    
5.  Click Search
    to generate bid requests.
    

    

    Note: Bid requests are generated
    using a 0.001% sampling rate. If you try to generate a bid request
    and don't see results, Xandr will
    automatically increase the sampling rate to 5%. Wait 30 minutes for
    this sampling rate change to take effect before you generate another
    bid request. You don't have to keep the
    Bid Request Sampler section
    open while you wait 30 minutes before generating a new request. You
    can leave the section and come back to generate a new request after
    30 minutes have passed.

    

    

    

    Bid requests (if any) are listed in the
    Bid Request section. You can
    do the following with Bid
    Request results:
    - Download generated bid requests as a text file by clicking
      Export All as Text File. The
      text file is downloaded to your browserâ€™s downloads folder.
    - Copy the generated bid requests by clicking
      Copy Request to Clipboard.
    - Open the generated bid requests in a new browser tab by clicking
      Open in New Window.
