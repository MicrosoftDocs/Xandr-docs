# Sell-Side Services



At Xandr, some publishers will keep preexisting
ad tags on their pages; others will use new
Xandr tags. It depends on their original ad
serving solution and the ways in which they wish to modify that solution
with Xandr services.

There are two main implementations for selling inventory though
Xandr:

1\)
<a href="tinytags.md"
class="xref" target="_blank">TinyTags.</a> TinyTags are the most
straightforward solution. A TinyTag is placed on a publisher's page. The
most basic form of a TinyTag is: `ib.adnexus.com/tt?id=123`.

2\) <a
href="preemptive-tags.md"
class="xref" target="_blank">Preemptive Tags.</a> PriceCheck is used in
conjunction with another ad solution, usually an exchange. PriceCheck
can either refer to a modified TinyTag or to keeping a preexisting tag.

TinyTag and PriceCheck tags are associated with unique IDs that map to
tag data stored server side. This means that once tags are in place, you
can modify them without having to re-tag the page. Simply add or change
information within Xandr storage.
