# Receive a Notify Request





<div id="ID-00001a2b__note-b2c30f9e-c295-4898-b931-d848159588b0"

The impression bus responds to a Bid Response with a Notify Request
(see <a
href="https://docs.xandr.com/bundle/xandr-bidders/page/notify-request.html"
class="xref" target="_blank">Notify Request</a> for more details). The
Notify Request communicates the auction results, bid response time, and
any errors generated by that particular bidder's bid response(s).  This
may include whether or not the bidder won the auction(s).



Tip: Notify requests are not sent for
debug auctions. To receive notify requests use the following auction URL
instead.

A notify request may signal that the bidder won or lost, or that the
results are pending the publisher's decision. This third category is
used for impressions that have a second auction after the
impression bus. For example, certain aggregators take the winning bid
from Xandr (subject to <a
href="https://docs.xandr.com/bundle/xandr-bidders/page/price-reduction-mechanics.html"
class="xref" target="_blank">Price Reduction Mechanics</a>) and apply
their own decisioning logic.



Tip: By using the <a
href="https://docs.xandr.com/bundle/xandr-bidders/page/bidder-service.html"
class="xref" target="_blank">Bidder Service</a>, a bidder may adjust the
Notify Requests sent by the impression bus.







A sample notify request is below. Based on the bidder's notify
parameters and whether the bidder has bid on a particular auction, the
Notify Request may look different.

``` pre
{  
   "notify_request":{
      "timestamp":"2016-12-09 00:11:44",
      "response_time_ms":4,
      "tags":[
         {
            "id":474074,
            "auction_id_64":7606327141949238687,
            "payment_rule_id":65930,
            "price_paid":0.90000,
            "member_id":670,
            "notify_type":"won"
         }
      ],
      "responses":[
         {
            "result":"ok",
            "price_bid":1.00000
         }
      ]
   }
}
```
