# Offline conversion attribution in Microsoft Invest

"Offline" attribution is [conversion attribution](conversion-attribution.md)
 that involves pushing all of the data processing
required for conversion attribution "offline" to the
Xandr data warehouse.

Offline attribution provides:

- **Scalability**: First and foremost, performing conversion attribution
  at scale is a hard problem. Attributing conversions requires sorting
  through immense amounts of data, very quickly, in order to find a
  salient conversion event. Doing so efficiently is challenging. Offline
  attribution removes a number of steps from the attribution process, as
  well as removing components of our data processing infrastructure that
  did not scale well.
- **Accuracy**: Offline attribution more accurately implements the
  "last-view/last-click" attribution model. In particular, it more
  accurately attributes conversions when the elapsed time between the
  conversion pixel firing and a view or click is very short. It also
  tracks conversions for impression trackers, whereas the previous
  design did not. For more information about the "last-view/last-click"
  attribution model that we use, see  [conversion attribution](conversion-attribution.md).
- **Flexibility**: This architecture provides us with more flexibility
  in how we implement conversion attribution models. As such, this
  change prepares our system to handle additional attribution models
  beyond "last-view/last-click."

## Conversion attribution, "Online" vs. "Offline"

The following diagram shows the major components involved in the
conversion attribution process, as well as the steps that occur between
a user converting and that conversion being attributed and made
available in reporting. The left side of the diagram shows the previous
"online" conversion attribution process. The right side of the diagram
shows the current "offline" process.

## Previous method ("Online")

### Step 1. Conversion pixel loads

The user's browser loads the conversion landing page, which fires the
conversion pixel hosted by the **Impression Bus**.

### Step 2. User data is requested by the Impression Bus

The **Impression Bus** asks the **User Data** store for information on
the user.

### Step 3. User data is returned to the Impression Bus

The **User Data** store responds to the **Impression Bus** with
information about the user.

Because of the nature of the design of the data store, and the speed
with which it must respond to requests, the information about the user
it can pass to the **Impression Bus** in this step is limited. It is
also unable to receive information about views or clicks as quickly as
it must respond to requests for the latest view and click information.
As a result, the information can be slightly out of date - where
"slightly" is measured in seconds - leading to less accuracy in
attributing conversions.

### Step 4. User data is passed to Microsoft's Bidder

The **Impression Bus** passes along the information about the user it
received from the **User Data** store to
**Microsoft's Bidder** for attribution.

### Step 5. Attribution is performed by **Microsoft's Bidder**

**Microsoft's Bidder** performs the actual  [conversion attribution](conversion-attribution.md), searching the user's data for the most recent view or
click associated with the advertiser's creative.

### Step 6. User data is passed to the data warehouse for additional processing

**Microsoft's Bidder** has attributed the
conversion, and passes that information along to the **Data Warehouse**,
along with the information it was given by the **Impression Bus** and
**User Data** store.

As noted in Step 3, the user information the **User Data** store can
provide is limited. That limited set of data on the user must now go
through a lengthy post-processing step, whereby it is combined with the
more comprehensive user data stored in the **Data Warehouse**.

### Step 7. Conversion-related data is made available for reporting, optimization, and budget

The **Data Warehouse** has finished post-processing the limited amount
of information on the converted user passed along from the **User Data**
storage and integrating it with its own, more comprehensive data. At
this point, the conversion-related data is made available to the
Xandr Platform for reporting, optimization, and
budget purposes.

## Current Method ("Offline")

### Step 1. Conversion pixel loads

The user's browser loads the conversion landing page, which fires the
conversion pixel hosted by the **Impression Bus**.

### Step 2. Impression-level data is sent to the Data Warehouse

The **Impression Bus** passes along the data it has about the impression
and the user to the **Data Warehouse**.

### Step 3. Conversion is attributed, other data is processed

The **Data Warehouse** receives information about the impression and the
user from the **Impression Bus**. As you can see from the diagram, the
**User Data** store is now located within the **Data Warehouse**. This
allows for faster integration and processing of the data provided by the
**Impression Bus**.

### Step 4. Conversion-related data is made available for reporting,
optimization, and budget

The **Data Warehouse** has finished processing and integrating the
information on the impression and the converted user passed along from
the **Impression Bus**. At this point, the impression- and
conversion-related data is made available to the
Xandr Platform for reporting, optimization, and
budget purposes.
