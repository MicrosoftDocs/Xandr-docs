use cases that may apply to your business, reach out to your
Xandr representative.



Yield management (YM) tools allow networks and their publishers to set
floor (minimum bid price) and bias (bid modifying) rules that enable you
to exert more control over impression pricing. These tools help you to
serve creatives with the highest yields for publishers, allow publishers
to express preferences for creatives from certain buyers over others,
and avoid channel conflict with directly negotiated deals.

YM rules are set up per publisher and can apply to various impression
properties including:

- The specific audience the network is trying to reach, based on
  geographic region or marketing segment
- The type of creatives that are most desired, e.g., those that
  synchronize with the publisher's content
- Whether the creatives involved would create channel conflict
