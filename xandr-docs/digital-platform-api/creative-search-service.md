# Digital Platform API - Creative Search service

This read-only service allows you to search for **active** creatives ased on specific criteria, such as audit status, ID, size, etc. You may then wish to use these creative IDs in the [Ad Profile Service](ad-profile-service.md). To add creatives to the system, see the [Creative Service](creative-service.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Since this service searches all active creatives on the AppNexus platform (not just your own), a search that is too broad might cause an error. To ensure that you get results, narrow your search as much as possible.

This API also enables certain native fields searchable through creative search.

The searchable fields are as follows:

- title (1)
- description (2)
- call_to_action (3)
- additional_description (13)

The search will return a creative if the search term matches any text in any of the aforementioned fields.

## REST API

| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `POST` | [https://api.appnexus.com/creative-search](https://api.appnexus.com/creative-search)<br> (creative_search JSON) | Search for creatives. |
| `POST` | [https://api.appnexus.com/creative-search?sort=FIELD_NAME.ASC_OR_DESC](https://api.appnexus.com/creative-search?sort=FIELD_NAME.ASC_OR_DESC)<br>(creative_search JSON) | Search for creatives and sort results. |

> [!NOTE]
> The fields used to search for creatives are not exactly the same as the fields returned. This is because the returned objects are drawn from the [Creative Service](creative-service.md) and formatted accordingly.
