# Updating a Case



Log in to
the <a href="https://help.xandr.com" class="xref" target="_blank">Customer
Support Portal</a> to access your full case history, knowledge base
articles, or request support.

You can use the Customer Support Portal to view all your cases and all
the cases on which you've been copied, to close or reopen cases, and to
add comments or attachments.



## View a case

To view an existing case, you can click the case link in the email
confirmation, or navigate to the case using the tabs on the portal home
page.

- **My Cases** - Displays all your open cases.
- **CC Cases** - Displays the cases on which you're copied.
- **Closed Cases** - Displays all your closed cases.



When you click one of the case tabs, a list of matching cases appears,
sorted by the date opened in ascending order. The support category,
subject, status, and date opened is displayed for each case. Click on
the case to view the complete case details, including comments and
attachments.





## Add a comment

Go to the case in the portal, type your comment in the comment box, and
click Comment. The new comment appears
in the case message thread, and you (and any addresses you have included
as cc email addresses) will receive an email confirmation of the
comment.





## Add an attachment

Go to the case in the portal, and click Upload Files to select your
attachment or drag and drop them into that area. After the file has been
added, refresh the page for the attachment to appear in the attachment
list in the right column.

## Edit an open case

Go to any open case view (My Cases, CC Cases) in the portal, and click
the down-arrow to the right. The case edit view will appear, where you
can make the updates and add/remove cc'ed emails. Once done, click
Save.

## Close an open case

Go to the case in the portal and click Close
Case in the right column. 

 ![XCS Part L](media/xcs-l.png)
The status in the case header changes to "Closed" and the button changes
to read **Re-Open Case**.





## Re-open a closed case

Go to the case in the portal and click
Re-Open Case in the right column.

 ![XCS Part M](media/xcs-m.png)

The status in the case header changes to "Open" and the button changes
to read **Close Case**. It's a good idea to add a comment explaining why
you're re-opening the case.  





<b>Note:</b> If you comment on a closed case,
it will be re-opened automatically.
