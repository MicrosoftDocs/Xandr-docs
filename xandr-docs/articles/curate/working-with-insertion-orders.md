# Microsoft Curate - Working with Insertion Orders

Insertion orders allow you to easily manage collections of line items
that may share a common budget, time span, and business terms. Insertion
orders are a standard part of the [Object Hierarchy](object-hierarchy.md). An insertion order can contain one or more line items. For example, you may
want to set a common budget and billing periods for several line items,
but have each line item target a different region or buy different types
of media.
