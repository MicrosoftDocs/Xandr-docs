# Network Ad quality screen

The **Network Ad Quality** screen performs several functions:

- Displays Network Profile settings
- Displays Publisher Templates. For each template, the screen displays how many publishers are using it
- Allows you to update network-level ad quality settings such as the Network Profile or any Publisher Templates
- Informs you of new brands as they are added to the platform

This document describes the various sections of the **Network Ad Quality** screen and their functions. For more information on how to create or update these settings, see [Update Your Network Profile](update-your-network-profile.md) or [Create a Publisher Template](create-a-publisher-template.md).

## Navigation

Click the **Network** tab at the top left of the screen. Choose **Ad Quality** from the menu that appears.

## Profiles and templates

This section lists the Network Profile and the Publisher Templates you've created if any. The column to the right of each Publisher Template shows how many publishers are using that template.

## Ad quality standards

This section is where you can determine which creatives serve on your inventory based on their creative attributes. You can also set frequency caps based on those attributes.

### Buyers
