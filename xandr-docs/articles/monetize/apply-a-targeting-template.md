# Apply a targeting template

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This form of targeting is only available to Standard Line Items. For an overview of which targeting options are available to Standard versus Augmented Line items, see [Buy-Side Targeting](buy-side-targeting.md).

Targeting templates allow you to apply pre-established inventory and user targeting settings to campaigns.

To apply a targeting template during campaign setup, simply select the relevant template from the **Apply Template** drop-down.

> [!NOTE]
> After applying a template, you can edit your targeting settings as needed or apply a different template, but you cannot reset your targeting settings to pre-template state.
