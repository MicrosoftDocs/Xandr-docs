# Microsoft Monetize - Create a user

You can create users and assign them to various roles. Each role gives the user a different level of access to your account. You can also create users who, rather than having network access, have access only to reports for specific advertisers or publishers. For each user you can personalize the formats used for decimals and large numbers. This page walks you through the process.

## Create a network user

Network users have access to various areas and functionality of your Network based on the roles and permissions you specify. Only users with the **User Manager** role can create a Network User.

### User details

#### Getting there

You add network users in the **Network** section of Monetize. Go to **Network** > **Users** and then click the **+ New** button. This opens the **Create User** dialog.

#### Enter contact information

From the **User Details** tab, enter the user's **Contact Information**.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The email ID enetered here will be the primary username for signing into the Microsoft Advertising products via the Microsoft Identity Platform. Ensure the email is consistent across any accounts in the Microsoft Advertising platform, and matches the user's email for authenticating to Microsoft products. For more details, visit [Microsoft Identity Platform Login](microsoft-identity-platform-login.md).
> - If the **State** is set to **Inactive**, the user will not be able to log in.

#### Select numerical formatting

Within the **Contact Information** section you'll also find options for numeric formatting. From the **Reporting Decimal Format** and **Numerical Format** dropdowns, select the formats that are conventional in the user's geographical location. Numbers throughout Monetize will be displayed in the format chosen here for this user.

- **Reporting Decimal Format** - Select whether a **Point** or **Comma** should be used for decimals when viewing numbers in reports.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > When the **Comma** format is selected, users will not be able to export a report using CSV format.

- **Numerical Format** - Select the thousand separator and decimal mark for numbers everywhere in Monetize except in reporting. This setting controls both how numbers appear to the user as well as how numbers can be entered by the user.

#### Provide API username and app permissions

- **Login Credentials**: Enter a username. The username should not contain any special characters such as $, #, and ". This will be the username the user can use to sign into the Microsoft Advertising API. For accessing the Microsoft Advertising Digital Platform UI products, the user's email will be used via the Microsoft Identity Platform to authenticate.
- **Permissions**: If this user needs to view billing information in Monetize, select the **Admin User** check box.

### Roles & permissions

On the **Roles & Permission** tab, select the user role with the appropriate access rights for this particular user.

> [!NOTE]
> Once the user has been created, you will not be able to change the user's role. To grant someone a different level of access to Monetize, you will have to create a new user.

- **Network Administrators** can view and edit all sections of Monetize (**Network**, **Advertisers**, **Publishers**, and **Apps**) and can run any report.
- **Network Observers** can view all sections of Monetize (**Network**, **Advertisers**, **Publishers**, and **Apps**) and can run any report but do not have editing capabilities.
- **Network Advertiser Managers** can view and edit the **Advertiser** section of Monetize for the advertisers to which they are assigned.
- **Network Publisher Managers** can view and edit the **Publisher** section of Monetize for the publishers to which they are assigned.

If you select **Network Advertiser Manager** or **Network Publisher Manager**, you will be presented with a selection box where you can select various advertisers or publishers to either include, or exclude from the user's access.

If you select **Network** or **Network Advertiser Manager**, you will also have the option to set **Peer Approval Status** for the user.

Check the **User must have peer approval to activate campaigns** checkbox if you want to require approval from another user on the network before this user's campaigns can be set to **Active**. This feature minimizes the risk of user-side errors in campaign activation and can help users identify and change settings to improve campaign performance.

> [!NOTE]
> The campaign peer approval feature sets requirements for who must obtain approval, but not who has the ability to approve. Any other user who is able to create campaigns for your network can provide this approval. There is no way to designate a single approver of others' campaigns.

## Create an advertiser user

You can create users for advertisers that want to run reports for themselves. Only users with the **User Manager** and/or **Network Advertiser Manager** role can create an Advertiser User.

> [!NOTE]
> This is not the same as the Network Advertiser Manager user: an advertiser user does not see data about any other advertisers and does not have editing capabilities.

The following steps walk you through the creation process.

1. You add advertiser users in the **Advertiser** section of Monetize. Go to **Advertisers** > **Users** and select the advertiser for which you want to create a user.

1. On the **Advertiser Users** screen, click **Add User**. This opens the **Create New User** dialog.

1. In the **Contact Information** section, enter the user's information. Also, select whether a point or comma should be used for decimals in the reports received by this user. The user **State** defaults to **Active**. Setting the state to **Inactive** will prevent the user from logging in.

1. In the **Login Credentials** section, enter the username that the user will use to log in to Monetize. The username should not contain any special characters such as $, #, and ". The username and password will be sent to the email address entered in the **Contact Information** section.

1. To finish creating the new advertiser user, click **Save**. The user is then added to the list of advertiser users.

## Create a publisher user

You can create users for publishers that want to run reports for themselves. Only users with the **User Manager** and/or **Network Publisher Manager** role can create a Publisher User.

> [!NOTE]
> This is not the same as the Network Publisher Manager user: a publisher user does not see data about any other publishers and does not have editing capabilities.

The following steps walk you through the creation process.

1. You add publisher users in the **Publisher** section of Monetize. Go to **Publishers** > **Users** and select the publisher for which you want to create a user.

1. On the **Publisher Users** screen, click **Add User**. This opens the **Create New User** dialog.

1. In the **Contact Information** section, enter the user's information. Also, select whether a point or comma should be used for decimals in the reports received by this user. The user **State** defaults to **Active**. Setting the state to **Inactive** will prevent the user from logging in.

1. In the **Login Credentials** section, enter the username that the user will use to log in to Monetize. The username should not contain any special characters such as $, #, and ". The username and password will be sent to the email address entered in the **Contact Information** section.
