# Explore Publisher Ad Quality





The Publisher Ad Quality screen
performs several functions:

- Allows you to view network-level ad quality settings such as your
  Network Profile or Publisher Templates

- Displays your Publisher Base and Conditional Rules. For each rule, the
  screen displays whether that rule is inheriting from a template

- Informs you of new brands as they are added to the platform

  This document describes the various sections of the
  Publisher Ad Quality screen and
  their functions.

Navigation

Choose Ad Quality from the
**Publishers** menu. Select the
publisher from the dialog. Alternatively, from the
Publishers screen, click on or hover
over the publisher you want to work with. Select
Ad Quality from the
**Go to** menu for that publisher.

Network Profile

You can view your Network Profile settings here. To edit them, you'll
need to go to the
<a href="network-ad-quality-screen.html" class="xref">Network Ad Quality
Screen</a>. For more information, see
<a href="update-your-network-profile.html" class="xref">Update Your
Network Profile</a>.

Base and Conditional Rules

You can view and edit your Base and Conditional Rules here. If those
rules inherit from a template, they will be marked as such. When a rule
inherits from a template, it cannot be edited except by a network
administrator. For more information, see
<a href="create-publisher-ad-quality-rules.html" class="xref">Create
Publisher Ad Quality Rules</a>.

Ad Quality Standards

This section is where you can determine which creatives serve on your
inventory based on their creative attributes. You can also set frequency
caps based on those attributes.

Buyers

Edit the trust levels associated with individual buying members.

Categories

Determine which categories of creative are eligible, e.g. "Airlines" or
"Apparel."

Technical Attributes

Determine the eligibility of creatives based on technical attributes
such as "Expandables" or "Flash."

Brands



Allow or exclude creatives based on the brands they are associated with.
You can apply a filter to see only new brands.



Note: If an Ad Quality (AQ) is set as
`default_brand_status:banned` but the parent brand is set as
`status:trusted`, the child brand overrides the setting in
`default_brand_status` and it will be able to serve unless it is
explicitly banned in the Ad Profile's brand override list.





Languages

Include or exclude creatives based on the language of the creative.

Ad Servers

Choose to serve only those creatives that are hosted on a specific set
of ad server domains (see
<a href="ad-server-settings.html" class="xref">Ad Server Settings</a>
for more information on creating collections of eligible or banned ad
servers). (Not available to all customers.)

Frequency Caps

Apply per-user frequency caps to creatives based on their technical
attributes. You can also set frequency caps on creatives belonging to a
sensitive category, e.g. "Alcoholic Beverages and References."

Creative Approval

Under the Creative Approval tab you
can search for creatives based on criteria such as who they're managed
by or where they served. You can then approve or ban those creatives.

Common Searches

parameters, including:

- **Creatives that have served:** Search for creatives that have served
  on your network's inventory within a specified time period.
- **Creatives that have been uploaded:** Search for creatives of a
  specific brand status that have been uploaded within a specified time
