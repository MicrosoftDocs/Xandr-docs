1.  Go to
    Advertisers
    \> Creative
    Manager.
2.  Select an advertiser.
3.  Click New and
    select Bulk.
    

    The Create New Creatives:
    Hosted screen displays.

    
4.  Do one of the following:
    - To add video, audio, and display creatives that will be hosted
      with Xandr, remain on the
      Create New Creatives: Hosted
      screen.
    - To add native creatives that will be hosted with
      Xandr, click the
      Native button.
    - To add video, audio, and display creatives that will be trafficked
      through a third-party ad server, click the
      Third-Party button.

    

    If you clicked the Native or
    Third-Party button, the
    appropriate Create New
    Creatives screen will display.

    
5.  Upload the creatives by doing one of the
    following:
    1.  Drag and drop the actual assets or click
        Select File to locate them
        from your computer.
    2.  For hosted and native creatives, click
        Select File (xls, xlsx) within
        the Creative Spreadsheet
        section and upload the assets using a spreadsheet.
    3.  For third-party creatives, click
        Select File (xls, xlsx, txt using
        Sizmek formatting) within the
        Creative Spreadsheet
        section and upload the assets using a spreadsheet.

    

    

    Note: You can upload files up to 8
    MB. All hosted banner and video creatives should not exceed 1 GB. To
    prevent latency issues, it's recommended that you only upload 200
    creatives at a time.

    

    
6.  Do one of the following if uploading the assets
    using a spreadsheet:
    1.  If all columns were successfully mapped,
        verify that no additional changes are needed.
    2.  If all columns were not successfully
        mapped, use the available menus to manually select the
        corresponding column names that were included in your
        spreadsheet, and then click
        Review.

9.  Add additional creatives to each tab at any
    time by clicking Add to Creative
    List.
10. Click
    Save.
    

    The Warnings & Errors dialog
    displays. The Warnings &
    Errors dialog may contain a list of warnings and errors.
    

    Note:
    The creatives will still upload successfully and display in the
    Creative Manager if you decide
    not to address any of the warnings. After the creatives have been
    successfully uploaded, you can make any updates by clicking the
    appropriate folder from the
    Folders pane that displays on
    the left within the Creative
    Manager, clicking the row for the appropriate creative, and
    clicking Edit from the
    Creative Details pane.

    

    
11. Click Save
    from the Warnings & Errors
    dialog.
    

    Your creatives won't be saved if errors exist for any of the
    creatives. You'll be redirected to the
    Create New Creatives screen so
    that you can resolve those errors. Creatives that have been uploaded
    successfully will no longer display in any of the tabs on the
    Create New Creatives screen.

    
12. From the Create
    New Creatives screen, resolve all warnings and errors by
    doing the following if necessary:
    1.  Review the
        Status column per tab to
        obtain additional information about each error and
        warning.
    2.  Make the necessary updates.
    3.  Click
        Save.

    

    If no additional errors exist, then your creatives will appear in
    the Creative Manager. If
    additional errors exist, repeat step 12.
