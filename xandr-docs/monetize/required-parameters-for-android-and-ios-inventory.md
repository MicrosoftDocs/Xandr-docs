# Required tag parameters for Android and iOS inventory

You can separate your mobile device tags into Android and iOS tags, or use the `ifa` and `ifa_type` parameters, `aaid`, or `idfa` to dynamically pass the device identifier and device type in the query string. Note that you'll need additional parameters such as width and height to monetize your inventory, unless these values have been set on the placement.

The following examples show how to implement device type and identifiers on a sample server-side tag.

```

```

Android and iOS tags require the following parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Required? | Compatible Handlers | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| `appid` (mobile) | string | Yes | `ptv`, `ssptv`, `vmap`, `ssvmap` | This string is used to identify a mobile app running on Android or iOS devices.<br> - On Android, this is the app's package name. It's formatted as follows: `com.example.helloworld`.<br> - On iOS, this is the app's numeric iOS store ID, auto-generated by the App Store. It's formatted as follows: `123456789`.<br>Many buyers set campaign targeting and reporting based on appid. Failing to supply a correct `appid` will make your inventory unattractive to these buyers. Therefore, passing this field is strongly recommended when `supply_type` is set to `mobile_app`. Note that this is what our Mobile SDKs do when they request an ad. See the Example to understand how our SDK passes the `appid`.<br>To find the app ID for a particular Android or IOS app, find the app's detail page, which you can find using a web search. The URL of the app store's detail page will show the app's ID. For example, here are the detail pages for the "Fussball" app:<br> - Google Play: `https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.telekom.FUSSBALL.DE`<br> - iTunes: `https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/fussball.de/id422052549` |
| `id` | string | Yes | `ptv`, `ssptv`, `vmap`, `ssvmap` | The unique ID of the placement where the ad will serve. If you'd rather not pass the raw placement ID, you can pass in a combination of `member` and `inv_code` parameters. For more information, see "Target Video Attributes via Query Parameters." |
| `ifa` | string | Required to monetize inventory | `ptv`, `ssptv`, `vmap`, `ssvmap` | The unique device identifier using the UUID standard (8-4-4-4-12) |
| `ifa_type` | string | Required to monetize inventory | `ptv`, `ssptv`, `vmap`, `ssvmap` | Possible values are `aaid` (Android), `idfa` (AppleTV), `afai` (Amazon Fire), `msai` (Microsoft), `rida` (Roku), `ppid`, `tifa` (Tizen (Samsung)), `vida` (Vizio), `lgudid` (LG).<br>**Note**: If you can't dynamically pass in device or platform IDs, you should use:<br> - `ifa_type=openudid` for CTV ad requests if you have authentication data and can pass persistent IDs<br> - &ifa_type=sessionid if you don't have authentication data with persistent IDs |
| `referrer` | string | Required for desktop and mobile web only | `ptv`, `ssptv`, `vmap`, `ssvmap` | The URL where the ad will be rendered |
| `vcontext` | int | Required to monetize inventory | `ptv`, `ssptv` | Position of the video placement. Possible Values:<br>- 1 - Linear Pre-roll<br> - 2 - Linear Mid-roll<br> - 3 - Linear Post-roll<br> - 4 - Outstream<br> - 5 - Bannerstream <br> - 6 - In-Feed <br> - 7 - Interstitial <br> - 8 - Accompanying Content Pre-roll <br> - 9 - Accompanying Content Mid-roll <br> - 10 - Accompanying Content Post-roll <br><br>**Note**: For reference on the corresponding OpenRTB 2.6 fields (`video.plcmt`) mapped to `vcontext` values, see the [OpenRTB 2.6 documentation](../supply-partners/integration-with-openrtb-2-6.md). |
| `vframeworks` | int | Required to monetize inventory | `ptv`, `ssptv`, `vmap`, `ssvmap` | Frameworks supported by the player. Possible values:<br> - 1 - VPAID 1.0<br> - 2 - VPAID 2.0<br> - 3 - MRAID-1<br> - 4 - MRAID-2<br> - 5 - ORMMA<br> - 6 - OMID-1<br>**Note**: `vframeworks` supports single as well as a list of comma-separated integer values. For example,<br>`vframeworks=1,2,3`<br>or<br>`vframeworks=1`. |
| `vheight` | int | Required to monetize inventory | `ptv`, `ssptv`, `vmap`, `ssvmap` | Player height (in pixels). While not required, this parameter is recommended in order to ensure video bidders receive both width and height on bid requests. |
| `vmaxduration` | int | No | `ptv`, `ssptv`, `vmap`, `ssvmap` | For single requests, this is the maximum video placement duration in seconds. Any creative with a duration longer than this value will be excluded from the auction. For podded inventory, this is the length of the full pod. |
| `vwidth` | int | Required to monetize inventory | `ptv`, `ssptv`, `vmap`, `ssvmap` | Player width (in pixels). While not required, this parameter is recommended in order to ensure video bidders receive both width and height on bid requests. |
