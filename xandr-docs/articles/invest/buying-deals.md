# Microsoft Invest - Buy deals

A deal is an agreement between a buyer and a seller that provides special access to inventory and/or data. There are two ways to strike
deals with sellers:

- **[Get Deals from Seller Packages](get-deals-from-seller-packages.md)**: Browse sellers' pre-made combinations of
  inventory and/or data and immediately convert them into deals or use them as a jumping-off point for custom deal negotiations.
- **[Negotiate Deals with Sellers](negotiate-deals-with-sellers.md)**: If you don't find packages that meet your needs, kick off negotiations for one-off deals with sellers.
