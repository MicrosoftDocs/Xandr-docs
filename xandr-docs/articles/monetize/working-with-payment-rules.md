# Working with payment rules

Payment Rules represent a financial agreement between a network and a publisher. A network may have a single payment rule for all impressions from a publisher, or it might have a **base rule** that serves as a default. More specific **conditional rules** can be defined that apply to individual impressions based on geography, frequency, or other
targeting.
