# Evaluate the yield of an order

The following article explais about evaluation and other processes to measure the yield of an order.

## Process flow
Use the **Orders** tab and Evaluate Orders to see how a proposal is expected to deliver and be consumed.

1. On the **Orders** tab, in the Order Tasks panel, click **Evaluate Orders**.
1. Use the Filters panel to find the proposal to evaluate:
    - The Time Period filter searches the order's start date.
    - The Order, Order Status, Advertiser, Agency, Industry, and Salesperson filters search parameters imported from your order management system.
    - The Flags filter searches for orders that have pricing (! Price) or availability (! Avails) flags.
1. Click on the order in the Orders panel list to select it. A preview of the order appears in the Order details panel below.
1. In the Order details panel, click the name of the order to open it in Evaluate Orders, or click **View** and select Evaluate Orders.
1. In the Key Metrics panel of the **Order Analytics** tab of the Evaluate Orders page, view the bar charts to compare the selected order to all other orders, making any additional changes:
    1. Change the comparison basis by clicking **All Customers** and selecting one of the following four values:
        - All Customers
        - This Industry
        - This Agency
        - This Advertiser
    1. Change the time period for the comparison's underlying data. By default, the time period is the Last 365 Days.
1. On the Order Composition panel, view the two pie charts:
    - The Contracted Revenue by Pricing Type chart shows how much of the order's revenue is associated with CPM vs. CPD placements.
    - The Contracted Revenue by Contract Type pie chart shows how much of the order's revenue is associated with standard placements vs. sponsorships.
1. Click the **Order Lines** tab to evaluate order lines in the focus order. This uses filters to find specific order lines, and flags to highlight pricing or availability issues.

## Add a proposal to a scenario

You can add a proposal or an order to Scenario Manager to better understand how it impacts other orders.

1. On the **Orders** tab, in the Order Tasks panel, click **Evaluate Orders**.
1. In the **Evaluate Orders Search** page, in the Orders panel, click on the order.
1. In the Order preview panel, click the order's name to open it in Evaluate Orders.
1. Click **Add to Scenario** at the top of the page. The order is added to a scenario.
1. Go to Scenario Manager to run the scenario.

## Using alternative products to solve pricing/availability issues

Alternative products are available in Evaluate Orders to help resolve ! Price and ! Avails flags.

### About alternate products

The Score for an alternate product indicates how closely it's related to the order line's product, based on the following criteria:

- Alternate sizes – Products with the same targeting as the order line's product, but with a different value for Size.
- Audience affinity – Products that heavily overlap the same set of other products.
- Purchase behavior – Products that frequently appear together on the same orders.

### View alternate products

In the Product Details panel, click the **Alternate Products** tab.

### Add an alternate product to a proposal

1. Click the **Add** button to the left of the product's name. A new order line with the selected product is created at the top of the **Order Line Listing** above the **Product Details**.
1. Enter or change the order line parameters (e.g., Start date, End date, Imps) as needed.
1. Click **Update**.

To remove the order line, click **Edit** and clear the **Included** checkbox.
## Flags in evaluate orders

Use the flags in Evaluate Orders to find and resolve potential availability and pricing issues related to the line items on each proposal.

### Types of flags

There are three types of flags in Evaluate Orders:

- ! Price flags (CPM order lines only) indicate when the sold CPM value is either below the floor price or below the configured discount threshold.
- ! Avails flags indicate that a line item is targeting a product that does not have enough available impressions to accommodate the order line.
- ! Sellthru flags indicate that an order line is targeting a product that is more than 50% sold through, though the percentage is configurable for your agency.
