# Search user groups

If you have administrative permissions, you can quickly search for user groups by group name, username, or permission. For example, you may want to find all user groups to which a certain username belongs, or you may want to find all groups that have permissions for a particular feature.

1. On the **Admin Tools** menu, click **Permissions**. The **Permissions** page appears, displaying the **Groups** panel with a table of all existing user groups.
1. In the **Search** panel on the left side of the page, type your criteria for the groups you want to find as follows:
    - To search for groups by name, type a value in the **Group Name** field.
    - To search for groups that contain a specific username, type a value in the **User Name** field.
    - To search for groups with access to a specific feature, type a value in the **Permission (Feature Name)** field.
    - To search for multiple values in a single field, separate the values with a semicolon (e.g., to search for all groups that contain "ad" or "ops," type **ad;ops**).
1. Click **Search**. The **Groups** panel is redisplayed to show only the groups that meet your search criteria.
