# Microsoft Invest - Create and activate a plan

From the **Planning** tab, you can create a plan that lets you experiment with line item targeting settings, understand inventory availability and reach, and seamlessly create a line item from your completed plan.

This page provides instructions on creating and activating a plan for your ad campaign. To create a plan, log into your account on our Microsoft Invest platform.

> [!NOTE]
> To achieve accurate forecasting results, Planner needs to be able to match a minimum number of impressions or users to the plan's targeting criteria. If the plan yields too small a number of impression or user matches, Planner displays an error rather than attempting to provide forecasting data.

1. Select the **Planning** tab.

   The **Planning** screen is displayed, showing any already-configured plans. You can select any plan to edit it, duplicate it, or create and activate a line item based on it.

1. Select **Daily**, **Weekly**, or **Full Flight** at the top of the right pane if you want to change the scope of the plan. Selecting **Full Flight** lets you choose specific start and end dates.
1. If you selected **Full Flight**, select start and end dates on the **Setup** tab in the left pane.
1. In the **Setup** pane, enter your **CPM, Advertiser, Supply,** and **Ad Type** details.

    When you select **Generate Plan**, Planner populates the right pane with information about the available inventory and predicted delivery based on your pre-targeting settings.

1. Select the **Targeting** tab and experiment with settings to see how applying targeting changes the affected availability and delivery for your plan. Select **Generate Plan** to create the initial projections.

    Select **Update Plan** after making changes to see how they affect your results.

    You can use the graphs to identify where inventory is available, so you can target a specific audience without risking non-delivery of your ads.

1. Select **Save** to save your plan or **Cancel** to cancel your selections.
1. To activate a plan by creating a new line item, select **Create Line Item**.

    Invest DSP opens the line item settings for a new line item based on the information in your plan. Your new line item won't serve until you have set it to be active (it will be inactive by default) and saved it.
  
   > [!NOTE]
   > You can also activate a plan from the **Planning** screen's list view by selecting the plan and selecting **Create Line Item** at the top right of the screen.
