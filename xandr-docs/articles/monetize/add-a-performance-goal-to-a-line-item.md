# Add a Performance Goal to a Line Item





Note: Performance goals are not
available for use with Guaranteed Line Items.



Performance goals (sometimes known as "primary KPIs") are a feature on
the line item that helps you to make strategic decisions about the
balance of performance and delivery for your campaigns. This page walks
you through the process of adding a performance goal to a line item and
fine-tuning performance goal settings to ensure your campaigns are
succeeding.



Tip: For a general overview of
performance goals and key use cases, see
<a href="understanding-performance-goals.html"
class="xref">Understanding Performance Goals</a> and
<a href="using-performance-goals-with-cpm-booked-revenue.html"
class="xref">Using Performance Goals with CPM Booked Revenue</a>.



Step 1. Get started

To set a new performance goal, go to
Advertiser
 \>  All Advertisers and
click the advertiser you want to work with. This takes you to the
Advertiser Details screen.

From the Advertiser Details screen,
click Line Items. This takes you to
the Line Items screen. You can either
create a new line item and set a performance goal for it or add a
performance goal to an existing line item.

Add a performance goal to an existing line item

Then, from the Line Items screen,
mouse over the line item to which you want to add a performance goal and
click the edit icon that appears.

Add a performance goal to a new line item

You can also add a performance goal to a new line item during initial
line item setup by clicking +New on
the Line Items screen.



Tip: To learn more about setting up a
line item from start to finish, including performance goals, see

Standard Line Item</a>.



Step 2. Set the goal type

Optimization (to a performance goal) selections are made via the
Primary KPI menu. You may set your
line item to a primary KPI of CPC, CPA, or CTR.



Important: Optimization to a Primary
KPI works in conjunction with CPM, CPC, or CPA revenue types when
advertisers want to meet goals that are different from the payment types
they have chosen (e.g., an advertiser wants to pay CPM but would like
you to meet a $50 CPA primary KPI). For all campaigns under the line
item, the Xandr optimization engine will
consider your entries in the
Optimization section fields when
deciding whether or not to bid on inventory.



For more information on the relationship between revenue and tracking,
see <a href="using-performance-goals-with-cpm-booked-revenue.html"
class="xref">Using Performance Goals with CPM Booked Revenue</a>.

Set a Primary KPI of CPC

Select this option if your advertiser wants to achieve a goal based on
clicks. Note that this option is not available when your revenue type is
CPC. Complete the Track performance against
client goal of $\_\_ field, entering the performance goal your
advertiser has given you. If you would like to set a bid/no bid
decisioning limit, check the **Do not bid if post-click eCPC is above
\_\_** checkbox and enter the limit in the empty field.



Note: The
Track performance against client goal of
$ field uses this value for reporting purposes only. The **Do not
bid if post-click eCPC is above** checkbox controls the bid/no bid
decision.



Set a Primary KPI of CPA

Select this option if your advertiser wants to achieve a goal based on
conversions. When you select CPA as the goal type, you must then select
the correct conversion pixel(s) to pay attention to. Then, complete the
Track performance against client goal of
$\_\_ field, entering the performance goal your advertiser has
given you. If you would like to set a bid/no bid decisioning limit,
check the Do not bid if post-click eCPA is
above $ \_\_ checkbox and enter the limit in the empty field.



Note: The
Track performance against client goal of
$ field uses this value for reporting purposes only. The **Do not
bid if post-click eCPA is above** checkbox controls the bid/no bid
decision.



Set a Primary KPI of CTR

Select this option if your advertiser wants to achieve a goal based on
click-through-rate. Complete the Track
performance against client goal of $\_\_ field, entering the
performance goal your advertiser has given you. If you would like to set
a bid/no bid decisioning limit, check the Do
not bid if CTR is below \_\_% checkbox and enter the limit in the
empty field.



Note: The
Track performance against client goal of
$ field uses this value for reporting purposes only. The **Do not
bid if CTR is below** checkbox controls the bid/no bid decision.



Step 3. Save the line item

When you have finished setting the performance goal for the line item,
click the Save button. This takes you
back to the
<a href="explore-line-items.html" class="xref">Explore Line Items</a>.
You can view the performance goals on the line item by hovering over the
row for that line item and clicking the graph icon that appears. This
takes you to the
<a href="view-line-item-details.html" class="xref">View Line Item
Details</a>, which contains details about all of the settings for that
line item.



Note: During learn, the
Xandr platform will continuously review the
campaign's performance and exclude low-performing inventory to help the
campaign optimize faster. Once the campaign moves into the optimization
phase, performance goals on the line item perform a bid/no bid check
using the data collected in the learn phase to determine a valuation.
The default threshold for moving into the optimization phase is three
success events. This setting can be changed using the
Phase Thresholds setting under
Optimization Levers at the campaign
level. For more details about optimization, see
<a href="optimization-levers.html" class="xref">Optimization Levers</a>.
