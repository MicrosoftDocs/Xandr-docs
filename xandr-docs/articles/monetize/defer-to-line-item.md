# Defer to Line Item



If you have a Line Item with a **CPA booked Revenue** it may take some
time to collect enough data to optimize to conversions. You may wish to
first optimize to a clicks or another event that is on the path to a
conversion, because the first action is more common than an actual
conversion. This makes sense if you believe that there is a strong
correlation between the rate at which users click on a creative and the
rate at which they convert.

How It Works

You will select a CPA booked revenue and a CPC campaign bidding
strategy, and check **Defer to Line Item**. Once you have 10 conversions
for a campaign-creative size-inventory source bucket, that bucket will
switch to a CPA bidding strategy based on Booked Revenue. And once that
bucket is optimized it will bid based on a Line Item Margin.

How to Turn It On

When you create or edit a campaign and, in the
Buying Strategies section, optimize
the campaign to a predicted CPA or CPC goal, under
Other Options you will see
**Optimization Levers**.

If you click the Edit button, you can
then check the **Defer to Line Item** box at the top of the dialog that
opens. **Defer to Line Item** allows you to first optimize to your
campaign bidding strategy, and then - when you have enough data - to
your Line Item Booked Revenue.
