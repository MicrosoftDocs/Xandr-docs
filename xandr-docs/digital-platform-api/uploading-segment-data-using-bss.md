# Digital Platform API - Uploading segment data using BSS

As described in this document, adding your segment file to the system is a multi-step process.

- Step 1: [Format your data file for upload](#format-your-data-file-for-upload).
- Step 2: [Request an upload URL and Job ID](#request-an-upload-url-and-job-id).
- Step 3: [Post the file to the upload URL](#post-the-file-to-the-upload-url).
- Step 4: [Check the job status](#check-the-job-status).

> [!NOTE]
> Files are limited to 1800 segments on any individual line. If you have more than 1800 segments for one user, you must break that line into multiple lines.

## Format your data file for upload

You have two options when creating a data file for BSS: The [Legacy BSS File Format](legacy-bss-file-format.md) and the **newer**, **preferred** [BSS Avro File Format](bss-avro-file-format.md), which uses a self-defined schema and supports a wider range of IDs beyond third-party cookies.

Note that your data file must meet the following requirements:

- Uses the Latin1 character set.
- Is a maximum of 0.5GB.

## Request an upload URL and job ID

Each segment data file that is uploaded must be associated with a particular job ID. This ID is used to create the upload URL and to track
the file's processing status. The first step is to send an empty `POST` request to the service.

This service works for both [api.appnexus.com](https://api.appnexus.com/) and for [api.adnxs.com](https://api.adnxs.com/). It is available for both bidder and UI logins.

```
$ curl -b cookies -X POST "https://api.appnexus.com/batch-segment?member_id=456"
 
{
  "response": {
    "id": 123,
    "status": "OK",
    "batch_segment_upload_job": {
      "job_id": "JFY8l6iMOFAFJIWCMPcy39MCt3Yleo1337618549",

    },
    "start_element": 0,
    "count": 1,
    "num_elements": 100,
    "dbg_info": {
      ...
    }
  }
  }
```

## `POST` the file to the upload URL

The file upload URL is given in the JSON response in Step 1 by the field `upload_url`: You will `POST` your segment file to this URL for
processing. Keep the following guidelines in mind:

- Do not hard-code the upload URL in your application. Make sure to dynamically grab it from the `upload_url` field.
- You must begin your upload to the given Upload URL within five (5) minutes, and only one URL is valid at any given time. If you wait longer than 5 minutes to start your upload, you must request a new URL.
- We recommend, you do not exceed one upload per minute. If you have more than 200 jobs waiting to be processed at any given time, you will be prohibited from uploading additional jobs.

> [!WARNING]
> To upload the file correctly, you must specify the MIME type in the HTTP header as `"Content-Type: application/octet-stream"`*.* Don't use `"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencode"` ( `-d or --data flags in curl`). Using an incorrect MIME type will prevent the file from being processed.

```
$ curl -v -H 'Content-Type:application/octet-stream' -b cookies -X POST --data-binary @segment_file "https://01.data-api.prod.adnxs.net/segment-upload/JFY8l6iMOFAFJIWCMPcy39MCt3Yleo1337618549"

### Example of SSL upload URL

```
curl -b cookie -c cookie -X POST -s -d '' "https://api.appnexus.com/batch-segment?member_id=958"
 
"batch_segment_upload_job": {
      "id": 14841671,
      "job_id": "qGQhSZ1qvd2hSsJ9svTz32qgxq7z5b1439315424",
      "member_id": 958,
      "last_modified": "2015-08-11 17:50:24",
      "upload_url": "https://data-api-gslb.adnxs.net/segment-upload/qGQhSZ1qvd2hSsJ9svTz32qgxq7z5b1439315424"
      }
```

## Check the job status

Finally, check the processing status by sending a `GET` request with the `job_id` returned from step 2 or 3. The JSON response contains
information such as how long the file took to process and the number of errors, if any. Note that you should wait until `phase="completed"` before looking at the results fields such as `num_valid`. For more detailed information, see [Troubleshooting BSS Uploads](troubleshooting-bss-uploads.md).

Per Xandr SLA, allow up to 24 hours for the file to process.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are a data provider using the Impbus API, note that the `batch_segment_upload_job` field will be an array with a single object inside of it. For example:
>
> ```
> {"batch_segment_upload_job":[{"phase":"completed" }]}
> ```

```
