# Online advertising self-regulatory organizations

Online advertising self-regulatory organizations are independent bodies
of experts and advertising technology professionals that help to
establish standards for quality and ethical conduct in the purchase,
sale, and display of online advertising.  
  
There are several such organizations currently active in the online
advertising sector in the United States, Canada, and Europe. This page
describes what the key organizations are, what they do, and key
projects, working groups, and objectives of each. 

## The digital advertising alliance (DAA)

The Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) is an online advertising industry
association made up of many other
[member organizations](https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org). Its focus is on ethical
self-regulation in the online advertising and ad tech industries, and
its purpose is to expand self-regulation for interest-based advertising
to the entire ecosystem.

The DAA is probably best known for it's Advertising Option Icon, also
known as the "Ad Choices" icon, which is an icon publishers can place on
their pages offering users options about what is happening when they
encounter advertising on a page and how they interact with that
advertising. When users see the Ad Choices Icon on a page, they can
click on the icon to learn what data is being gathered and how it's
being used, and, if they choose to, opt out of being included in this
data collection and usage process. To use the Ad Choices Icon,
publishers must pay an annual fee. More information about the Ad Choices
Icon is available on the
[DAA's web page](https://youradchoices.com/). 

The DAA also provides a comprehensive self-regulatory program, as well
as publications, recommendations, and misconduct reporting resources for
Internet users and companies involved with digital advertising. In
addition, they do policy and advocacy work to improve digital
advertising practices.
