## Example

### Create a JSON formatted report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` of `"multi_buyer_seller_deal_metrics"`, as well as the `columns` (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the `"format"` in which the data should be returned (`"csv"`, `"excel"`, or `"html"`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md).

```
$ cat multi_buyer_seller_deal_metrics

{
    "report": {
        "report_type": "multi_buyer_seller_deal_metrics",
        "columns": [
            "hour", 
            "buyer_member_name", 
            "deal_name", 
            "start_date", 
            "end_date", 
            "average_net_bid", 
            "imps_won", 
            "seller_revenue", 
            "reject_count"
        ],
        "filters": [{
            "deal_buyer_type": ["Buyer Member"]
        }],
        "report_interval": "last_7_days",
        "format": "csv"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the reporting service

```
$ curl -b cookies -X POST -d @multi_buyer_seller_deal_metrics 'https://api.appnexus.com/report'
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service

Make a `GET` call with the Report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592'
{
    "response": {
        "status": "OK",
        "report": {
            "name": null,
            "created_on": "2010-05-25 19:19:53",
            "json_request": "{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"multi_buyer_seller_deal_metrics\",\"columns\":[\"hour\",\
            "buyer_member_name\",\"deal_name\",\"start_date\",\"end_date\",\"average_net_bid\",\"imps_won\",\"seller_revenue\,\"reject_count\"],\
            "row_per\":[\"hour\",\"buyer_member_id\",\"deal_id\"],\
            "report_interval\":\"last_7_days\"}}",
            "url": "report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592"
        },
        "execution_status": "ready"
    }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the Report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and Report ID in the `url` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!NOTE]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `i` or `v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592' > /tmp/multi_buyer_seller_deal_metrics.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
