# Microsoft Monetize - Select an Audit Option for a Creative

When adding creatives, you can specify if you want to audit your own
creatives or have Microsoft Advertising audit them. An unaudited
creative can only run on your managed publishers. Unaudited creatives
aren't eligible to run on third-party inventory unless the seller
specifically allows it.

Select one of the following audit options from the
**Creative Quality** section:

- **Platform Audit**: Select this option
  to submit the creative for auditing by the
  Microsoft Advertising Audit team and perform the following:
  - Select a priority.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Business days are from 9:00pm Sunday to 11:59pm Friday ET.

    Microsoft Advertising charges a fee for each audited creative. Creatives are audited
    in the order that they are received with a target completion time of
    one business day from the submission time. Priority audits, which
    are available for an additional fee, are completed within two
    business hours. The **priority table** below lists the fee charged
    for audits conducted for different time durations.

  | Priority | Fee | Description |
  |---|---|---|
  | Regular one day audit | $1 USD | Fee charged for 1 Day Audit |
  | Priority audit | $25 USD | Fee charged for 2 Hour Audit |

    
  - Enter a desktop compatible URL in the
    **Brand URL** text field.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Brand URL** should contain the same branding that is represented on your CTV, OTT, or mobile creative. The Audit team will use the URL to validate the branding represented on the creative.

  - Select the **language** that is used
    in the creative such as French, German, or Chinese.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Modifying the selected language will cause the creative to be resubmitted for audit.

- **Self Audit**: Select this option to
  classify the creative on your own. For further guidance on
  self-auditing, see [Self-Auditing Creatives](self-auditing-creatives.md).

  > [!NOTE]
  > Self-auditing may reduce access to inventory outside of your network since many sellers only allow Microsoft Advertising audited creatives.

  Set any one of the following creative attributes:

  - **Brand**: This lets other sellers on
    the platform know what brands this creative is associated with in
    the system.
  - **Offer Categories**: This lets
    sellers know the offer category such as Education or Employment.
  - **Language**: The language used in the
    creative such as French, German, or Chinese.
  - **Technical Attributes**: It describes
    the features associated with the creative, such as whether it is a
    video.
  - **Sensitive Attributes**: These are
    often banned by publishers.

> [!NOTE]
> The Compliance must be confirmed for self audited creatives.

- **No Audit**: Select this option if you
  do not want the creative to be audited.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > When selecting **No Audit**, this may result in the creative serving less frequently, as publishers might choose to block it.

process and the content standards for creatives running on the
Microsoft Advertising platform, see [Auditing Creatives](auditing-creatives.md) and [Creative Standards](creative-standards.md). Regardless of your audit selection, the Microsoft Advertising Sherlock technology checks all creatives for overt malvertising threats and suspicious behavior.
