# Microsoft Monetize - Manage your deals with buyers

> [!NOTE]
> As of May 3, 2021, Imps Matched and Bid Requests will be randomly sampled at a rate of 10 percent. The sampled values will be multiplied by 10 to give a reasonable estimate in all screens where these two metrics are reported. No other deal metrics will be affected.

As a seller, you can manage all deals you have with buyers on the
**Deals** screen. You can view deal
details, monitor each deal's health, trigger detailed reports, edit or
cancel deals, and create new deals.

You can also manage your deals with a specific buyer on the [Partnership Details Screen - Buyer View](partnership-details-screen-buyer-view.md).

## Getting to the deals screen

To reach the **Deals** screen, select
**Partners**
\>  **Deals** in the main
navigation.

## Viewing basic and advanced deal metrics

The following details display for each deal. Columns that show an arrow
in the header when you hover over them are sortable.

- **Deal ID** - The ID of the deal.
- **Imps Matched** - The number of
  impressions matched to the deal.
- **Bid Requests** - The total number of
  bids requested from the buyer.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > For deals with an on-platform buyer, **Bid Requests** will equal **Imps Matched**. For deals with an external bidder, filtering due to the bidder's profile may reduce the number of Bid Requests.

- **Bid Rate** - The buyer's participation
  rate in the deal, which is the percentage of auctions in which the
  buyer bid.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > When the Xandr Impbus is doing the bidding for on-platform deals, all deals will be eligible for participation because they will have already passed quality and other eligibility checks on the platform. When third-party deals are active, the total number of bids may be greater than the number of bids marked eligible.

- **Final Bids** - The total number of
  auctions on which a buyer submitted eligible bids to participate in
  the deal.
- **Imps Sold** - The total number of imps
  sold on a given deal.
- **Gross Win Rate** - The percentage of
  impressions the buyer won out of bid requests sent to the buyer. This
  figure will be approximately equal to **Imps
  Won** divided by **Bid Requests**.
- **Net Win Rate** - The percentage of
  impressions the buyer won out of those the buyer bid upon. This figure
  will be approximately equal to **Imps
  Won** divided by **Bids**.
- **Ineligible Bids** - Information about
  bid ineligibility and the reasons bids were rejected.
  - **% Ineligible** - The percent of bids
    deemed ineligible.
  - **Reason** - The reason bids were
    rejected.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For more information on bid rejections, Impbus error codes, and actions buyers and sellers can take to resolve errors, see [Understanding Bid Rejections](understanding-bid-rejections.md).

- **Avg. Net Bid** - The average net bid
  CPM over all bids received. This figure does not include fees.
- **Floor** - The average floor price
  applied to all bids received, including both the deal floor and YM
  floors.
- **Rev eCPM** - The average revenue you
  made per bid on this deal. This figure has fees removed.
- **Revenue** - Your total revenue from
  this deal during the selected time interval, after fees. This value
  will be approximately equal to **Imps
  Sold** multiplied by Rev **eCPM**
  and divided by 1000.
- **Deal Settings**:
  - **Start/End Date** - The start and end
    dates for the deal.
  - **Type** - The auction type. For more
    information on the different auction types, see 
    [Deal Auction
    Mechanics](deal-auction-mechanics.md).
  - **Ask Price** - The price, if any,
    associated with the deal. This is the minimum amount you must bid in
    order to compete for the deal inventory.
  - **Suggested Min Bid** - The minimum
    bid value that will clear the seller's deal floor, net of fees.
  - **From Package** - Indicates whether
    or not the deal was generated from a package. Deals associated with
    a package are affected if the package's status changes.

## Managing Multi-Buyer deals

> [!NOTE]
> Multi-Buyer Deals is a **Closed Beta** feature. This feature is subject to change without notice and is only available to select clients. If you would like to participate in the Beta test, please contact your account manager.

When you look at a multi-buyer deal in
**Partners** \> **Deals with Buyers**, the
buyers are not listed under the **Buyer**
column. Instead, you'll simply see “Multiple Buyers” listed. Each
multi-buyer deal will show deal metrics in aggregate (combined across
buyers). See [Multi-Buyer Seller Deal Metrics](multi-buyer-seller-deal-metrics.md) to see deal metrics data broken out by buyer.

Use the **Filters** in the left column to
filter multi-buyer deals by both **DSP Filter**
and **Buyer Filter**
(Members/Seats). The filtered results will list any multi-buyer deals
that include the selected DSP or Buyer.

## Filtering and searching for deals

By default, you see all current deals. Use the
**Filters** in the left column to filter
by deal status or buyers, or use the search boxes to search for specific
deals or buyers.

## Monitoring deal health

Review the statistics for your deals to see how they are performing. If
the number of deal impressions shown is low, there may be an issue with
your deal settings or with your inventory. If the number of deal
impressions the buyer has bid on is low, the buyer may have campaign
setup issues.

## Viewing a specific deal's details

Click on a deal to display the
**Details** pane, where all of the
deal's details are visible. You can use the slider to resize the pane as
desired. You can edit or duplicate a deal directly from the
**Details** pane using the
**Edit** or
**Duplicate** button.

## Creating a new deal

Click New to create a deal. For
step-by-step instructions on creating a deal, see [Create a Custom
Deal](create-a-custom-deal.md).

## Duplicating a deal

Use the duplicate feature to easily create a new deal that is similar to
an existing deal, or to create the same deal for a different buyer.
Hover over the deal you would like to copy in order to display the
duplicate icon, and then click on the duplicate icon to display the
**Create Deal** panel.

## Editing a deal

Current and upcoming deals can be edited at any time. Hover over the
deal you would like to update in order to display the edit icon, and
then click on the edit icon to make the deal editable.

> [!WARNING]
> Campaigns targeting the deal will be immediately affected by the changes you make. Use the Activity Stream on the [Partnership Details Screen - Buyer View<](partnership-details-screen-buyer-view.md) to communicate with the buyer before making changes to the deal dates, auction type, inventory, segment, creative size, or brand.

After you have made the necessary updates, click
**Save** to save your changes. To exit
edit mode, click **Cancel**.

## Canceling a deal

If a current or upcoming deal no longer works for you, you can cancel it
at any time. Check the checkbox near a deal, and then click
**Actions** \> **Cancel Deals**.

> [!WARNING]
> Campaigns targeting the deal will stop serving when you cancel the deal. Use the Activity Stream on the [Partnership Details Screen - Buyer View](partnership-details-screen-buyer-view.md) to communicate with the buyer before canceling the deal.

## Reporting on deals

You can run reports to see how your deals are performing. Check the
checkbox near the desired deals, and then click
**Actions**
\> **Show in Reporting**.

A new tab opens displaying the [Network Analytics
Report](network-analytics-report.md) with the selected deals as filters and Deal selected as a
dimension.

Click **Run Report** in the reporting
screen to run the report with these settings, or select additional
settings as desired and then click **Run
Report**.

## Reporting on creatives served

To see which creatives have already served through a particular deal,
click on the name of the deal you wish to review. In the details pane
that opens below, under **Allowed
Creatives**, click the link under the
**Creatives Served** header.

This will open the reporting tab, where you can run a Seller Brand
Review report that has been pre-populated with the right filters and
dimensions for you.

Click **Run Report** to run the report
with these settings, or select additional settings as desired and then
click **Run Report**.

## Switching to buyer mode

If you are a network that also represents sellers, click the
**Sellers** button to view all of the
deals you have as a buyer.
