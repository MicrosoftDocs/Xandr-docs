# Inventory Targeting (ALI)



If you selected Managed under
Supply Strategy (in the
Basic Setup section of the line
item), you can target or exclude the following inventory:

- Universal Categories (for more detail, see below)
- Custom Categories (for more detail, see below)
- <a href="direct-inventory-targeting-ali.md" class="xref">Direct
  Inventory</a>

To target specific inventory, open the
Inventory & Brand Safety section.
Then click Edit next to
Managed Inventory. Use these settings
to limit the inventory your line item will target.

Universal and Custom categories:

- **Universal:** Universal categories are defined by
  Xandr. When Xandr
  reviews inventory, we apply these categories based on the inventory's
  content. For example, a car dealership placement group would be
  assigned to the "Autos & Vehicles" category. Sellers can apply
  universal categories when self-reviewing inventory as well.
- **Custom:** Custom categories are defined by sellers. Sellers create
  these and apply them to slices of their inventory to package their
  inventory for specific buyers to target.

Target Universal Categories

By default, your line item will target all universal categories.
However, you can narrow your targeting to include or exclude specific
universal categories.

1.  On the Universal Categories tab,
    include or exclude custom categories.
    - The Categories lists shows all
      top-level universal categories defined by
      Xandr. You can either include or exclude
      top-level categories or drill into a category to view its child
      categories.
    - The Sub-Categories list shows
      all child universal categories in the context of their parent
      categories. You can either include or exclude sub-categories. Note
      that when you exclude a top-level category, its sub-categories are
      not available for further inclusion or exclusion.

    

    <b>Note:</b> When targeting more than one
    universal category, the categories have an OR relationship. For
    example, if you target the "News" and "Finance" categories, you will
    bid on inventory that is in either category. The inventory does not
    need to be in both categories.

    
2.  Click Add.

Target Custom Categories

By default, your line item will target all custom categories. However,
you can narrow targeting to include or exclude specific custom
categories that you have applied to your own placement groups and/or
placements for direct buying as well as custom categories that other
sellers have exposed to you for third-party buying.

1.  On the Custom Categories tab,
    include or exclude custom categories.
    

    <b>Important:</b> When targeting more than
    one custom category, the categories have an OR relationship. For
    example, if you include "Custom Category 1" and "Custom Category 2",
    you will bid on inventory that is in either category. The inventory
    does not need to be in both categories.

    
2.  Click Add.
