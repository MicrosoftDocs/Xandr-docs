# Countries

Clicking the **Countries** tab
accesses a screen where you can select which countries you want to
receive. You can either **include** or **exclude** the desired countries
by clicking either the **green checkmark icon** (include), or the **red
minus sign icon** (exclude).

The **magnifying glass/search icon** can be used to search for the
desired country to include or exclude. Begin typing the name of the
country you want, and this list will narrow down to your specific
choice.

When you close the **Countries** tab,
a summary is shown in the upper right-hand corner of the **Countries**
display bar that shows that you've applied some sort of targeting.
*(Example:Â 1 Country Included).*
