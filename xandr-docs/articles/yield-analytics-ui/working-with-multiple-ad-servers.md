# Working With Multiple Ad Servers



The yield analytics interface supports the use of multiple ad servers
(e.g., if you use one for mobile, one for video, etc.). This makes it
easier to work with each one separately or all together. 



## Set the Default Ad Server

If you use multiple ad servers, you can specify which one is the
default.

1.  In the top right corner of any page, click your name, and then
    click Preferences. The Preferences
    page loads.
2.  In the Set Defaults panel, in the Ad
    server for filters field, click the link for the current
    setting and then select one of the following ad servers from the
    drop-down list that appears:
    - DFPP
    - FreeWheel
    - AdMarvel
3.  Click Save Defaults. 





## About Priority Labels

You can customize priority labels, which are searchable, organized from
high to low, and displayed throughout yield analytics. In addition,
yield analytics can hide priority labels that you don't use. Please
contact your services representative for more information.





## Filtering With Multiple Ad Servers

When you specify an ad server (e.g., for an availability lookup), the
rest of the filter options and lookup criteria are automatically
restricted to show only the products, attributes, and values for the ad
server. This helps you more easily locate the product you want. It also
eliminates potential duplicate instances (e.g., if two products for
different ad servers are named the same thing, only one will appear).

If you are using multiple ad servers (e.g., one for video, another for
mobile), you can select the ad server from the filter (e.g., Limit types
to those supported by and Limit attributes and values to those supported
by). 

When specifying the filter:

- Not Specified displays products that are not linked to a specific ad
  server.
- None Selected returns everything.



<b>Tip:</b> Note

Filtering by ad server filters the available product and attribute
options, not the actual data returned in the lookup or report. To filter
the availability lookup, specify ad_server as an Attribute.



For historical purposes, all ad servers that your agency has worked with
are filter options. If your agency doesn't use multiple ad servers but
has migrated ad servers, you can filter by ad server only on
the Contract Type for historical reporting. Clients that have migrated
ad servers will see this filter only on the Contract Type for historical
reporting.




## Specify Priority

If you're working with multiple ad servers (e.g., in Availability Lookup
or Scenario Manager) a dialog enables
you to specify priority for the secondary ad server.
