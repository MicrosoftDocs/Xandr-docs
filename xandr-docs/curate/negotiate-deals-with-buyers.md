# Microsoft Curate - Negotiate deals with buyers

Microsoft Advertising sellers can negotiate custom deals to offer buyers a variety of special rate and inventory access options. These include:

- Special access to premium inventory
- Inventory in bulk for discounted rates
- Other opportunities

This page explains how to negotiate and set up deals with both Microsoft Curate buyers as well as buyers using external bidders.

## Deals with Microsoft Curate buyers

You can negotiate deals with buyers on the Microsoft Advertising platform from the Partner Center.

For more information on communicating with buyers and viewing deals, see the [Partnership Details Screen - Seller View](partnership-details-screen-seller-view.md).

## Deals with external buyers (bidders)

### Step 1. Negotiate a deal

Negotiate a deal with the buyer offline. Then ask the buyer for their Microsoft Advertising member ID so you can set up the deal in Microsoft Curate.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not seen delivery from this bidder previously, be sure to ask the buyer to make sure that the bidder has you (the seller) in an allowlist in their bidder profile. This is an important step: if the bidder does not receive traffic from you, the buyer will not be able to buy through the negotiated deal.

### Step 2. Create a deal in Microsoft Curate

Create a curated deal line item (see [Create a Curated Deal Line Item](create-a-curated-deal-line-item.md)). Once the deal has been set up in Microsoft Curate, contact the buyer and give them the deal ID.

### Step 3. Buyers enter the deal into the bidder's UI

The buyer enters the deal ID into their bidder's system to have the bidder target the deal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When working with buyers using Doubleclick Bid Manager, you can direct them to Doubleclick's documentation for information on [entering a deal ID into Bid Manager](https://support.google.com/displayvideo/answer/3423616?hl=en).
