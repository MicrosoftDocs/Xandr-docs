# Microsoft Invest - Requirements for filing a support case for report discrepancies

To file a case exploring a possible report discrepancy with Product Support, you need to gather reports, including object IDs for the
relevant objects, and create a spreadsheet that shows a discrepancy greater than 10% (15% for mobile).

| Requirement | Detail |
|:---|:---|
| Make sure the discrepancy occurred within the last 90 days. | This requirement guarantees Microsoft Advertising can confirm the discrepancy, given that data retention policies vary. |
| Provide the reports from both Microsoft Advertising and the third party. | Ensure both reports: <br> - Contain data from the same time frame.<br> - Use the same time zone. <br><br> **Note:** UTC is the preferred time zone for submitting reports.<br><br> - Share the same methods for counting impressions and/or clicks. <br> - Specify which objects (campaign, placement, advertiser, or line item, for example) you're pulling data from. <br> - Include objects that clearly correspond with each other in the Microsoft Advertising and third-party reports. <br><br> **Note:** The Microsoft Advertising IDs of these objects must be noted in the Microsoft Advertising report. |
| Provide a spreadsheet (.csv or .xls) that includes both Microsoft Advertising and the third party's reporting data. You'll use this spreadsheet to demonstrate the discrepancy, which must be greater than 10% (or 15% for mobile apps). | Use this equation to calculate the discrepancy percentage:<br>(1 - (Microsoft Advertising's Report Metric/3rd-Party Report's Metric)) x 100 |
| Provide all the object IDs relevant to the discrepancy and their mappings, so Microsoft Advertising support can clearly identify the correspondence between the objects in each report. | For example, provide the advertiser ID, insertion order ID, creative ID(s), line item ID, seller ID, placement ID, and others. |
