# Buyer group service

You can create groups of buyers in order to apply similar yield management settings to them as a whole.

## REST API

| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description |

| `GET` | `https://api.appnexus.com/buyer-group?id=ID` | View a specific buyer group |
| `GET` | `https://api.appnexus.com/buyer-group` | View all buyer groups |
| `GET` | `https://api.appnexus.com/buyer-group/meta` | Find out which fields you can filter and sort by |

> [!NOTE]
