# Negotiate Deals with Sellers



Xandr Buyers can negotiate custom deals with
sellers to obtain:

- Preferential pricing on inventory
- Access to exclusive inventory
- Reduced competition on inventory
- Other opportunities

This page explains how to negotiate and set up deals with sellers and
external supply partners.

Deals with Sellers

As a buyer, the best way to find deals is to browse seller packages,
which are pre-made combinations of inventory and/or data that can be
immediately converted into deals or can be used as a jumping-off point
for custom deal negotiations. For more details, see
<a href="get-deals-from-seller-packages.md" class="xref">Get Deals
from Seller Packages</a>.

Deals with External Supply Partners

At this time, Xandr supports deals with the
following external supply partners:

- AOL One Display
- Google Ad Manager
- ONE by AOL Mobile Marketplace
- Pubmatic
- Rubicon
- SpotX
- StickyADS
- Teads TV
- Yahoo Ad Exchange

You must negotiate deals with these supply partners offline and save
them in the partner's deal portal. Xandr will
then automatically synchronize the deals with our system; they should be
available for purchase within a few hours of creation. Please note that
Xandr employees cannot explain these external
supply partner's auction mechanics or deal types. To
learn about auction mechanics for deals with sellers, see
<a href="deal-auction-mechanics.md" class="xref">Deal Auction
Mechanics</a>.



<b>Note:</b> Each deal ID can be associated
only with a single buyer. Enter one buyer member when setting up a deal
in the external supply partner's system. If multiple members are
entered, Xandr will map the deal only to the
first buyer member.
