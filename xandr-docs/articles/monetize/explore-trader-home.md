Viewing Insertion Order Details

To view advanced details about an insertion order, click the insertion
order's name. See
<a href="view-insertion-order-details.html" class="xref"
title="The Insertion Order Details screen displays settings for a specific insertion order, essential metrics, and performance visualizations.">View
Insertion Order Details</a> for more information.

Viewing Insertion Order Metrics

Each card displays metrics to help you assess the status of your
insertion orders. The insertion order card provides easy access to the
pacing health of your insertion order and what is needed to successfully
deliver.

There are three important metrics presented on each card:

- Yesterday Spend - Amount of your
  budget you spent yesterday (between 00:00:00 to 23:59:59 UTC).
- Current Daily Needed - Amount of
  spend needed daily (including today) for the rest of the flight in
  order to stay on pace.
- Pacing at - Percentage determined by
  comparing Yesterday's Spend to how
  much daily spend is needed for the rest of the flight
  (Current Daily Needed).



Important: These metrics display in the
insertion order's currency or in impressions, depending on how the
insertion order's budget was configured.



Viewing the Performance Chart

Each card displays a performance chart that tracks the insertion order's
Average CPA/CPC and
Daily CPA/CPC as of yesterday.



Tip: You can view specific details down
to the day by hovering over the graph to show the exact CPA or CPC for
that date.



Viewing Flight Dates

The card displays the number of Days Left in
Flight for the insertion order. The units of time remaining in
the flight will switch to hours when there are 48 hours or less left.



Warning: The flight must be added to
the insertion order for the card to display all of the metrics. For
information on how to add a flight, see
<a href="create-an-insertion-order.html" class="xref">Create an
Insertion Order</a>.



Viewing Card States

The color of each card will change according to the status of the
insertion order:

- **Red** - Warning: Pacing at value
  is less than 90% or greater than 150%.
- **Black** - Normal: Pacing at value
  is between 90% and 150%.
- **Blue** - Note: More insertion order information is needed to display
  full pacing data.

Each card falls into one of the nine states outlined in the table below.
