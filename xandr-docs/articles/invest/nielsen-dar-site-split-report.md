## To Run your report

Follow these steps to run the report:

1. Select
    **Reporting
    \> Advertiser Reports** from
    the dropdown menu (depending on how your account has been
    configured).
1. Select the relevant report from the list. The **Report** screen shows the available filters, dimensions, and delivery options for the report. Theselections you make here will determine what report data is delivered to you, and how.
  
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > For an explanation of how grouping and filtering work see [Dimensions, Metrics, Filtering, and Grouping](dimensions-metrics-filtering-and-grouping.md).
  
1. Select the relevant filters to limit the data displayed to just the information you want. For example, rather than running a report that shows impressions for all inventory sources, you may want to list results for just a select few. When you select a filter (by clicking **Edit**), a selection panel appears. Select items in the **Available** list (left), then click **Add** to include them in the
    **Chosen** list (right).
1. Group by Dimension. Grouping allows you to display rows of data in
    the order you prefer.

   > [!WARNING]
   > The more dimensions you group by, the larger the data set that is returned. Larger data sets can take substantially longer to process. Be sure to group using only the dimensions you need.

1. Choose a delivery option. Once you've selected your filters and
    grouped by your chosen dimensions, you need to choose a delivery
    method. Available delivery methods include:
    - **Run now, show results in screen**: For smaller amounts of data,
      you may want to view the report as soon as possible in your
      browser.
    - **Run in background, notify me when results are ready to view**: A
      pop-up notification will let you know when the report is ready to
      view or download.
    - **Export, send results via email**: Run the report in the
      background and email the results to one or more email addresses.
    - **Save as report template**: Save your selected report settings so
      that you can run this report again in the future. You can name
      this template using the text entry field under
      Name this report (its checkbox
      is auto-selected when you choose this option). A saved report can
      be rerun from the Your Reports
      screen.
    - **Add to scheduled reports**: Run this report automatically at
      specified times and have it sent to one or more email addresses.
    - **Name this report**: Give this report with its current settings a
      name for future reference.
1. Click **Run report** to send your
    report request.
