# Using the Buyer Monitoring Grids



Invest DSP consists of these three grids:
Advertisers,
Insertion Orders, and
Line Items. These buyer monitoring
grids help campaign managers monitor delivery and performance for
insertion orders and line items across advertisers.



## Viewing Metrics



Various metrics are available and organized as follows per grid:

<table id="ID-000000ae__table_3191f7d7-361c-4881-b50b-aec046cb56f2"
class="table frame-all">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead class="thead">
<tr class="header row">
<th
id="ID-000000ae__table_3191f7d7-361c-4881-b50b-aec046cb56f2__entry__1"
class="entry">Grid</th>
<th
id="ID-000000ae__table_3191f7d7-361c-4881-b50b-aec046cb56f2__entry__2"
class="entry">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody class="tbody">
<tr class="odd row">
<td class="entry"
headers="ID-000000ae__table_3191f7d7-361c-4881-b50b-aec046cb56f2__entry__1">Advertisers</td>
<td class="entry"
headers="ID-000000ae__table_3191f7d7-361c-4881-b50b-aec046cb56f2__entry__2">Metrics
are organized by advertiser to present a holistic delivery and
performance outlook for each one.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even row">
<td class="entry"
headers="ID-000000ae__table_3191f7d7-361c-4881-b50b-aec046cb56f2__entry__1">Insertion
Orders and Line Items</td>
<td class="entry"
headers="ID-000000ae__table_3191f7d7-361c-4881-b50b-aec046cb56f2__entry__2"><p>Metrics
are organized by object.</p>

The Insertion Orders and <span
class="keyword wintitle">Line Items grids consist of three tabs:
Upcoming, <span
class="ph uicontrol">In Progress, and <span
class="ph uicontrol">Completed. Insertion orders and line items
move into the:
<ul>
<li>Upcoming tab on the hour that they
go live.</li>
<li>In Progress tab when they are
between flights (start date/time of the first flight and end date/time
of the last flight).</li>
<li>Completed tab on the hour that
they have completed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The metrics provided on these tabs will vary.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



These metrics are cached regularly to provide fast access. Use the
tooltips that display at the top of each column to better understand how
these metrics are calculated.



<b>Note:</b> Because these metrics are cached
more regularly than the reporting data, there may be discrepancies
between them. For more information, see
<a href="availability-of-reporting-data.md" class="xref">Availability
of Reporting Data</a>.






## Searching for Objects

You can use the search field at the top of the buyer monitoring grids to
search for objects by name, ID, or code.



<b>Note:</b> Inactive objects will display
with their name, ID, and metrics grayed out.





If you don't know the specific name, ID, or code for an object, search
for it using the pagination functionality at the bottom of the grids:

1.  Select the number of rows that you want to display per page by
    selecting a value from the Rows per
    page menu.
2.  Enter a specific page in the designated text field or click the
    right arrow to navigate from page to page.





## Configuring Custom Filters



You can create, apply, and save custom filters. To configure custom
filters:

1.  Click Advanced Filters.

2.  Make your selections.

3.  Click the arrow to the right of the
    Apply button.

4.  Select Apply and Save As.

    To apply a filter to the grid without saving it for future use,
    click the Apply button.

5.  Enter a name for the new filter.

6.  Select the Make Default checkbox
    if you want the filter to be automatically applied to the grid by
    default.

7.  Click the Apply and Save As
    button.

    All saved filters are available from the
    Select a Filter pull-down menu. To
    remove an applied filter, click Clear
    All.

    You can update any saved filter at any time. To update any of the
    saved filters, click the Edit link
    or click Advanced Filters. From
    the Advanced Filters dialog,
    you can rename, delete, or make the saved filter a default filter.






## Sorting and Showing/Hiding Columns

Click the name of the column to sort columns in ascending or descending
order.

You can also choose the columns that you want to show or hide by
clicking Modify Columns. This opens
the Modify Columns dialog. Select
or deselect the columns that you want to show or hide.




## Viewing Object Details

To view specific object details, click anywhere in the corresponding row
in the grid. From the Details
pane, you can view the necessary details for that object and additional
details for child objects.



To view child object details:

1.  Click the Associated Objects menu
    on the right of the Details
    pane.
2.  Select the appropriate object category such as
    Creatives.
