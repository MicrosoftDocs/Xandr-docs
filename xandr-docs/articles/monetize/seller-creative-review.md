# Seller Creative Review



Sellers can use Microsoft Monetize Seller Creative
Review to review and approve creatives before they serve on seller
inventory.

Seller Creative Review lets you make exceptions to your ad quality
preferences by only allowing creatives that you approve run on your
inventory through specific deals that meet your business requirements.
Seller Creative Review only works in concert with deals you specify and
can’t be used to enable any creative that would otherwise be blocked by
your ad quality preferences from running on open exchange inventory.
