# Third-Party Tracking Pixels for Creatives



Third-party tracking pixels are used for a variety of purposes such as
performing ad verification and collecting data about the creative.

Third-party tracking pixels can be created at either the advertiser or
Network level and associated with the
appropriate creatives. You can also associate custom third-party
tracking pixels with your creatives if you want to use another system to
track impressions.

There are many advantages to creating and associating third-party
tracking pixels at the advertiser or Network
level. For example, creating and applying third-party tracking pixels at
the advertiser or Network level saves time by
eliminating manual steps. In some situations, instead of creating these
tracking pixels for each advertiser, it might be more efficient to
create and add tracking pixels at the Network
level. These Network-level pixels can then be
applied to creatives under any advertiser for the
Network.

Also, since creatives are frequently added and removed, tracking pixels
can be attached at the advertiser or Network
level to avoid having to re-attach the same pixels to numerous
creatives, which only simplifies workflows and reduces setup errors.
