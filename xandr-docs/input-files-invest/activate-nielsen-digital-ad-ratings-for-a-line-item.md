# Activate Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings for a Line Item


For $0.25 CPM, you can activate Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings (DAR) for
your augmented line item. Nielsen DAR is a feature used to measure your
line item's performance in reaching a particular demographic (gender and
age group) that has no affect on your line item's actual targeting or
delivery.

1.  Go to the
    Measurement section.
2.  Enable Audience
    Demo.
    

    After Nielsen has confirmed your line item, audience data tracking
    for your line item's associated creatives begins. A green check mark
    displays under the toggle switch to indicate that this confirmation
    has occurred.
    

    <b>Note:</b> It can take Nielsen up to 24
    hours to confirm your line item after saving.

    
    
3.  Set an On Target %
    Goal.

    <b>Note:</b> On
    Target % Goal is for reporting purposes to show how your line
    item is performing and has no effect on your line item's
    performance.

    For information on Nielsen's On Target Percent metric, see [Metrics for Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings.](nielsen-dar-metrics.md)
