# Microsoft Monetize Supply for External Demand Partners



This page explains what Microsoft Monetize supply
is, our purpose in launching it, and other details helpful to working
with XandrMonetize supply.

## About Microsoft Monetize Supply



 Microsoft Monetize supply includes inventory that
we believe represents the most direct path to supply. This inventory is
brought to you directly through the Xandr SSP
technology, and is formed at its core from our direct-to-publisher
supply most frequently requested and purchased by our buyers across all
formats (display, mobile, video, and native). 

Our mission is to provide a safe high-quality easy-to-access marketplace
such that no other place can the core of this inventory be purchased
with fewer intermediaries taking fees (or adding hops) between the buyer
and the inventory owner.

## The Purpose of  Xandr Supply

In an effort to make buying Microsoft Monetize
on-platform inventory easier, we are moving towards a concept of
“marketplaces” over time. With Microsoft Monetize
supply, we are able to streamline the process by which both
Xandr and our partners manage access to supply.

We may be creating multiple marketplaces over time – but began with the
inventory from sources that we believe, on the whole, provide the most
direct path to supply in order to: 

- lower your cost of media (with fewer intermediaries taking a cut of
  the transaction),
- improve performance metrics (through lower latency and more direct
  access), and
- ensure a more transparent environment (by requiring confirmation that
  ad units are provided directly by the owners of the inventory or
  exclusive representatives).

## Seller Selection Criteria

A number of factors go into determining if a seller is eligible for
 Microsoft Monetize supply, including if the seller
owns and operates the inventory they sell, their inventory
relationships, inventory quality, size, geographic location, and
inventory formats. Xandr reserves discretion
over who is included in  Microsoft Monetize supply.

Microsoft Monetize supply includes all inventory
formats made available on the Microsoft Monetize
platform by the included sellers.  Xandr
Monetize supply is updated regularly with newly-onboarded inventory
sources for which both of the following are true. 

1.  The significant majority (\>75%) of a member’s traffic is the most
    direct path to supply as determined by the following factors:
    - The media is owned and operated (O&O) by the seller, and we are
      integrated with the member with a tag on page (including header
      bidding, server-of-record relationships, and direct tag in the
      publisher’s ad server) or through a direct server-side
      integration.
    - Alternately, the seller has an exclusive relationship with the
      publisher for access to a subset of inventory via a tag on page.
      The only way to get access to this inventory on
      Xandr is through the seller.
2.  We believe there is a low risk of invalid/fraudulent traffic because
    of the following:
    - We complete an audit of the inventory using our inventory quality
      technology to review for adherence to our policies (e.g. no
      pornography, nudity, hate speech) and require confirmation that
      the inventory is both valid and properly represented.
    - We require confirmation of the owner of the inventory, even if
      that inventory is available through an intermediary, along with
      confirmation that the media owner has approved the network to
      exclusively re-sell its inventory.

For an up-to-date lists of inventory available via
 Microsoft Monetize supply, please contact your
Partner Manager. We also plan on creating ways in the future for you to
view this information directly from our documentation  – and eventually
via the API, as well.

## Accessing  Microsoft Monetize Supply

 Microsoft Monetize supply will not appear in the
Bidder Service User Interface and will automatically be added to all
Bidder Profile allowlists. While access
to  Microsoft Monetize supply will be automatic and
will remain as a default setting with no direct ability to unselect this
group of inventory, your regional, format, ad size, domain blocklists,
and other targeting settings at the seat level will still be fully
respected and affect this inventory, as well.

Sellers can be blocked using the Bidder Service User Interface. Both
sellers and domains can be blocked using blocklists using the API.

## Evolving Marketplaces

Over time, Microsoft Monetize supply and other
marketplaces should replace the need to blocklist and allowlist
individual sellers and instead move toward a platform where you can
blocklist domains, as is the case with most other SSPs. We will
communicate with you and solicit feedback each step of the way in order
to make this change in ways that make buying on our platform easier and
more fruitful for you and your clients.
