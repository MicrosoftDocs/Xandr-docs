# Microsoft Monetize - Banner and HTML5 creatives (JP)

You can host common display creatives such as banner and HTML5 with
Microsoft Advertising or traffic them through third-party ad
servers.

## Banner creatives

Banner creatives are basic images or animations that can be formatted as
a JPEG, JPG, PNG, GIF, or SWF. They will typically appear above, below,
or alongside page content. Banner creatives can provide:

- **More visibility**: Since banner
  creatives tend to be more visually appealing than other creative
  types, they are a good way to draw customer attention and increase
  brand awareness.
- **Cost savings**: Banner creatives are
  easy to create with little cost involved.

## HTML5 creatives

HTML5 creatives are essentially mini web pages that are created using
multiple media files. HTML5 creatives can provide:

- **Better user experiences**: Unlike
  static banner creatives, HTML5 creatives tend to be more engaging.
  They also offer higher resolution quality and help with faster load
  times since they are small in file size.
- **Optimized performance**: With HTML5
  creatives, you can measure more than just CTR such as VCR.
