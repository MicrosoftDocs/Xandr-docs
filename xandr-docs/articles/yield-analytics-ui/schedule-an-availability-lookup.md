# Schedule an Availability Lookup



When you email a report to yourself or designated recipients you can
send it immediately or on a recurring schedule.

1.  On the Availability Lookup page, create a new lookup and save it.
2.  On the toolbar, click Send.
    The Send a Lookup Report dialog appears.
3.  On the Recurrence drop-down list, select how frequently you want the
    lookup to be sent, or
    select None to send the lookup
    immediately without scheduling it.
4.  In the Send To box, enter the email address for each recipient,
    separating each address with a comma. You can include up to 50 email
    addresses. To send a report to more than 50 addresses, use a
    distribution list. 
5.  (Optional) In the Message box, type any comments you want to include
    in the email. 
6.  (Optional) As needed, clear the check boxes for items to be included
    in the email.
    - If you're sharing the lookup with someone who doesn't have access
      to Yieldex Analytics, the recipient can't receive a URL Link to
      access the report. 
    - If you're sending the lookup as an Attachment, it includes the
      lookup results as an attachment to the email.
7.  Click Send.

The lookup results link will only display results while the forecast is
still valid (i.e., has not expired).

To schedule a lookup to run bi-monthly, create two monthly instances of
recurrence (e.g., one on the 1st and one on the 15th).

If you have administrative access, you can
select Admin Tools \> View Saved
Lookups to view, edit, and delete scheduled lookups.
