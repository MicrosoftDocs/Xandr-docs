Google Ad Manager Bids from Xandr

Every bid response submitted to Google Ad Manager by the
Xandr bidder contains a **dealid** field. The
**dealid** value depends on whether the bid was generated by
<a href="create-a-campaign.md" class="xref">campaign</a> or
<a href="create-a-deal-campaign.md" class="xref">deal campaign</a>.



- If the bid was generated by
  <a href="create-a-campaign.md" class="xref">campaign</a>,
  Xandr will pass back a value of **1**.
- If the bid was generated by
  <a href="create-a-deal-campaign.md" class="xref">deal campaign</a> ,
  Xandr will pass back the appropriate **Google
  Ad Manager deal ID** in the bid response.

For every Google Ad Manager impression containing a deal ID, the
Xandr bidder will submit all bids generated by
Deal Campaigns **in addition to** the single highest bid response per
Xandr Member generated by an open-auction
Campaign.



Bid Request - Bid Response Examples

To help you understand which deal ID(s) Xandr
will return to Google Ad Manager, we have provided several illustrative
campaign/targeting configuration samples below.

First, assume the following two campaigns exist:

**Campaign 1 - Open-Auction Campaign**

- **Domain:** Google Ad Managerexampledomain.com
- **Geo:** Germany
- **Base Bid:** $1.00 CPM

**Campaign 2 - Deal-targeted Campaign**

- **Deal ID:** 12345 \[corresponding to Google Ad Manager deal ID
  99999999999\]
- **Base Bid:** $2.00 CPM

The table below describes several hypothetical Google Ad Manager bid
requests and the respective bid responses submitted to Google Ad Manager
by Xandr.

Interpreting Bid Responses in Google Ad Manager's RTB Breakout UI

If you have your own Google Ad Manager Account (most Google Ad Manager
buyers do), you have access to the **Google Ad Manager RTB Breakout
UI**. As a result, you may have encountered something similar to the
following when troubleshooting non-delivery of deal campaigns. This
table presents some reasons why, for a given deal ID, Google Ad Manager
may log a substantial number of "Responses without bids for this deal".

![interpreting adx](media/interpreting_adx_bid_responses.png)


When you see **Bids not for this deal** in the **Google Ad Manager RTB
Breakout**, it means that the only campaigns that have bid on Google Ad
Manager impressions containing the relevant deal ID are Open-auction
Campaigns.

This is because bids containing **deal_id: 1** are not counted as bids
for any specific Google Ad Manager deal. This **does not mean** that the
Xandr bidder is unable to properly
target/respond to Google Ad Manager deals. However, it **may mean**:

- You have no active Xandr campaigns targeting
  the specific Google Ad Manager deal ID.
- The impressions sent with the specific Google Ad Manager deal ID do
  not match the targeting settings of any Xandr
  deal-targeted campaign.
- There are one or more Google Ad Manager Publisher blocks passed within
  the specific Google Ad Manager bid requests which exclude the
  Xandr deal-targeted campaign (e.g., a Deal
  Campaign with a single Creative whose brand category is "Apparel", but
  the Google Ad Manager Publisher with whom the deal has been created
  blocks "Apparel" across their inventory).
- There are additional mismatches between Xandr
  deal-targeted campaign/ creative parameters and Google Ad Manager
  blocks.
