# Create a programmatic guaranteed deal

Learn step by step how to create and customize a programmatic guaranteed (PG) deal through Microsoft Monetize Ad Server.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Creating PG deals through Monetize Ad Server is a **beta** feature. For more information, see [Selling Programmatic Guaranteed Deals](programmatic-guaranteed-selling-line-items.md).

## Before you begin

Before you begin creating a line item, you must have performed the following tasks:

- [Create an Advertiser](create-an-advertiser.md)
- [Create an Insertion Order](create-an-insertion-order.md)
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > To use PG selling line items, you need to create a **seamless insertion order** with no end date, no budget, and an **Impression** revenue type.

## Setting up a programmatic guaranteed deal

If you've created an advertiser and insertion order, then you're ready to begin creating a line item.

1. **Navigation**: [Navigate to the Create New Programmatic Guaranteed Deal Screen](navigate-to-the-create-a-new-deal-line-item-screen-monetize.md) to begin creating a PG selling line item.

1. **Deal type**: [Choose the Programmatic Guaranteed Deal Type](choose-the-programmatic-guaranteed-deal-type.md) to sell inventory to a programmatic buyer on a guaranteed basis (**Traffic a Programmatic Guaranteed Deal**).

1. **Basic setup**: Follow the instructions to [Add Basic Line Item Details](add-basic-line-item-details.md) and associate one or more insertion orders to the line item, as well as set an ad type, name, state, deal details, and supply strategy, all from the **Basic Setup** section.

1. **Inventory & brand safety**: [Set Up Line Item Inventory and Brand Safety](set-up-line-item-inventory-and-brand-safety-pgli-monetize.md) and select the type of inventory you want to include or exclude for your PG deal.

1. **Frequency & recency**: [Set Line Item Frequency and Recency Caps](set-line-item-frequency-and-recency-caps.md) to cap the number of times (*frequency*) and how often (*recency*) creatives can be shown to a given user.

1. **Targeting**: Follow the instructions in [Set Up Line Item Targeting](programmatic-guaranteed-selling-line-item-targeting.md) to set up targeting by geography, device type, key/value, daypart, system settings, segment settings, page properties, demographics, or viewability thresholds.

1. **Deal creative criteria**: [Define Deal Creative Criteria](define-deal-creative-criteria.md) to specify which creative attributes you allow for your deal.

1. **Reporting labels and comments**: [Add Reporting Labels and Comments to a Line Item](add-reporting-labels-and-comments-to-a-line-item.md) and optionally assign custom reporting labels to a line item so that you can create reports tracking metrics across line items, and you can add comments to your line item for personal reference.

1. **Inventory forecasting**: Follow the instructions in [Save and Reserve Inventory Space](inventory-forecasting.md) and use forecasting tools to see how much inventory you have available that meets your targeting setup.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Inventory Forecasting is only applicable to PG deals created for Microsoft Monetize Ad Server.
