# Find Orders





1.  On
    the Orders tab, in the Orders
    Tasks panel, click Find Orders. A
    list of all of the current month's orders appears, filtered by
    default to show all orders except those that have been cancelled.
    
2.  (Optional) Filter the orders list using
    the Filter panel: 
    - To filter the orders list by date,
      click This Month in the Date
      Range filter, specify a standard or custom time period, and
      click Update.

    - To filter the order list by status,
      click Includes x Values in
      the Status filter, click on a status to select or deselect it, and
      click Update. The selected
      statuses are displayed in a tooltip.
3.  In the search box in the toolbar above the
    order list, type a search term, change the search options as needed,
    and then press Enter. The order list is redisplayed to show only the
    orders that match your search criteria.  
    
    - By default, the search returns orders that contain the search term
      you entered. To change the type of search, on the drop-down list
      to the left of the search box,
      click Contains and select a
      different option (e.g., to search for orders that starts with the
      search term you typed, select Starts
      With).

    - By default, the search is run against the advertiser, order name,
      order ID, order line, and order line ID. To narrow the search to
      just one of these, click All in
      the drop-down list to the right of the search box and select a
      different option (e.g., to search for orders by order name only,
      select Order).
