# Digital Platform API - Buyer Segment Performance report

This report provides buyers with segment performance across campaigns and multiple advertisers.

The `time_granularity` of the data is `hourly`. For instructions on retrieving a report, see the [Report Service](report-service.md) or the [examples](#examples).

> [!NOTE]
> **Impressions across user segments:** Since this report aggregates impressions served by user segment, impressions associated with users who are present in multiple segments will be counted more than once. As a result, be sure to group by `segment_id` when running the report.

## Time frame

The `report_interval` field in the JSON request must be set to one of the following:

- today
- yesterday
- last_7_days
- last_14_days
- last_30_days

### Data retention period

Data retention period for this report is 45 days.

> [!NOTE]
> To run a report for a custom time frame, set the `start_date` and `end_date` fields in your report request. For more details about these fields, see [Report Service](report-service.md).

| `split_id` | int | yes | `342` | The ID of the split that purchased the impressions in this data set. Splits are only applicable to augmented line items. For any reports that contain campaigns, the `split_id` (if included) will be `null`. |
| `split_name` | string | yes | `"Mobile Split A"` | The name of the split that purchased the impressions in this data set. Splits are only applicable to augmented line items. For any reports that contain campaigns, the `split_name` (if included) will be `null`. |

Also, you can filter by no more than 10 conversion pixels. Although `pixel_id` is groupable, we do not recommend that you group by this dimension since doing so will cause conversion events to then be shown in separate rows from impression and click events. We generally assume you want to view all of these events in a single row so as to be able to retrieve accurate and aggregated values for conversion rate and cost-per-conversion calculations. As a result, we instead recommend that you filter by `pixel_id` so you can retrieve conversion counts and related metrics for your most relevant pixel ids. |

## Examples

### Create the JSON report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` of `"buyer_segment_performance"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and {{report_interval}} that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (year, month, day), and specify the format in which the data should be returned (csv, excel, or html). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](report-service.md).

```
$ cat buyer_segment_performance

{"report": 
    {
        "format": "csv",
        "report_interval": "yesterday",
        "row_per": ["campaign_id"],
        "columns": ["campaign_id", "segment_id", "advertiser_id", "advertiser_name","line_item_id"],
        "report_type": "buyer_segment_performance"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the Report Service

`POST` the JSON request to get back a report ID.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @buyer_segment_performance "https://api.appnexus.com/report"

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"71816ec6d09b32a5140730afe5cf6af5"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the Report Service

Make a `GET` call with the report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is
`"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=71816ec6d09b32a5140730afe5cf6af5'

{
    "response": {
        "status": "OK",
        "report": {
            "name": null,
            "created_on": "2014-11-19 21:15:10",
            "json_request": "{\"report\":{\"format\":\"csv\",\"report_interval\":\"yesterday\",\"row_per\":[\"campaign_id\"],\"columns\":[\"campaign_id\",\"segment_id\",\"advertiser_id\",\"advertiser_name\",\"line_item_id\"],\"report_type\":\"buyer_segment_performance\",\"filters\":[{\"member_id\":\"1234\"}]}}",
            "url": "report-download?id=71816ec6d09b32a5140730afe5cf6af5"
        },
        "execution_status": "ready"
    }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the Report Download Service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and report ID in the `url` field of the response to your previous `GET` call. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the file format that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!NOTE]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=71816ec6d09b32a5140730afe5cf6af5' > /tmp/buyer_segment_performance.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
