# Viewing visual success data

Visual Success is a tool designed to help campaign managers achieve better overall performance. It provides easy access to performance, delivery, and other metrics for your line item.

You can use the metrics within Visual Success to see how the campaigns under your line item are performing as a group, and assess for possible trouble spots at the campaign and line item levels. With Visual Success, you can:

- view flight progress, delivery, performance, and margin.
- scan for problems using easy-to-read data visualizations.
- keep track of how well line items are pacing to goals.
- hover over the visuals to see specific data for a single day.

Visual Success features appear at the top of the **Line Item Details** screen. The metrics sections and graphs show important information about the line item's flight, delivery, performance, and margin.
