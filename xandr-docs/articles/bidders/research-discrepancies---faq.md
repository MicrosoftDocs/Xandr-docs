# Research Discrepancies - FAQ



The following steps will walk you through researching and resolving
discrepancy issues. The idea is to get a report from your side and
compare it with the report on the Xandr side.

## Before Opening a Discrepancy Case

To open a discrepancy investigation case with the Xandr support team,
you must confirm the following:

- Discrepancy level is above 10% (15% for mobile).

  Anything below that threshold is an organic component of doing
  business in an RTB environment, implying different servers to
  communicate over a "public" network.

- Discrepancy occurred less than 15 days ago.

**If you have not verified these criteria, Xandr would not investigate
on the case.**

## Retrieve and review aggregated reports

You want to get the impression and spend figures by Seller, Publisher,
Tag ID, Domain, Creative Size, Creative ID and Geo from the Xandr
reporting UI (<a href="https://bidder.xandr.com/admin" class="xref"
target="_blank">https://bidder.xandr.com/</a>).

Next, retrieve the same report from your side. Compare the reports. We
suggest that you first check the data by days, then by the hours. (Be
sure to retrieve all the data based on the same time zone.)

- Get the discrepancy repartition by seller, publisher, tag ID, domain,
  creative size, creative ID, and geo.
- Identify if the discrepancy levels are the same within those features.

If you're able to identify the source of the discrepancy based on your
comparison of these reports, depending on the discrepancy level you
might want to:

- Exclude from your bidder profiles the inventory source causing the
  discrepancy.
- Determine why there is such discrepancy on a specific feature and
  attempt to resolve the issue.

Examples of possible issues discovered in these reports include:

- You see a large discrepancy in a particular geographic area on some
  creatives because an advertiser uses a "swap" technology on their
  creatives that swap the creative content with a blank if the creative
  is outside of the campaign scope.
- You see a large discrepancy with a specific seller because most of
  their pages are in https but your counting pixels are in http.

If the discrepancy level is the same over all sellers, publishers, tags,
domains, sizes, creatives, and geo, you might need to investigate the
user browser and operating system issues.
