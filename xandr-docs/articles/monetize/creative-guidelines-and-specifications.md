# Creative Guidelines and Specifications



To serve on the Xandr platform and other
third-party platforms, all creatives must adhere to the guidelines and
specifications listed here, our creative standards, and any other
guidelines that may apply.

>

>

Adhere to these guidelines and specifications when creating creatives of
any type:

- Avoid creating auto-initiated audio creatives as they are frequently
  blocked by publishers.
- Creatives must be in an approved format such as JPEG, PNG GIF, DHTML,
  HTML5, or JavaScript third-party ad tags from an approved ad server.
- After clicking the creative, the user must successfully be redirected
  to an acceptable landing page within a separate browser tab.
- The actual dimensions of the creative content must match the
  dimensions configured for the creative.
- Creatives may not use local shared objects (LSOs). Creatives hosted by
  Xandr or trafficked through the
  Xandr platform may not set Flash cookies or
  other LSOs for online behavioral advertising, delivery and reporting,
  or multi-site advertising. Prohibited uses include but are not limited
  to storing user IDs, interest segments, user browsing history, or
  other unique user data. LSOs include Flash cookies, browser helper
  objects, and HTML5 Local Storage.
- Creatives should not set, read, write, modify, or delete any cookie on
  a domain that Xandr owns or operates.
