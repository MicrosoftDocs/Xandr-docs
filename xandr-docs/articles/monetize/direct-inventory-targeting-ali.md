# Direct Inventory Targeting (ALI)



If your line item is set to buy direct inventory, it will target all of
your direct inventory by default. However, you can narrow your targeting
to include or exclude specific managed publishers, placement groups
(sites), or placements.

1.  In the Inventory & Brand Safety
    section, click Edit next to
    **Managed Inventory**.
2.  On the Direct Inventory tab,
    include or exclude direct inventory at the appropriate level:
    - The **Publishers** lists shows all of your managed publishers. You
      can either include or exclude publishers or drill into a publisher
      to view its placement groups.
    - The **Placement Groups** lists shows all of the placement groups
      under your managed publishers. You can either include or exclude
      placement groups or drill into a placement group to view its
      placements. Note that when you exclude a publisher, its sites are
      not available for further inclusion or exclusion.
    - The **Placements** list shows all placements under your managed
      publishers and placement groups. You can either include or exclude
      placements. Note that when you exclude a publisher or placement
      group, its placements are not available for further inclusion or
      exclusion.
3.  Click Add.
