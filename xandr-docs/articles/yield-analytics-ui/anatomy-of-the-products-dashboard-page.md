# Anatomy of the products dashboard page

The Products Dashboard page is the primary view for the **Product** tab. It provides a summary of:

- Products at risk of underdelivering
- Products with the best consumption
- Product performance across products

> [!TIP]
> From any of the pages within the **Products** tab, you can click a product to see its full details on the **Product Visibility** page.

## About the products dashboard interface

The **Products Dashboard** page consists of the following three widgets:

- **Revenue Against Goal** – Displays revenue against goal for the most at-risk products across your network or within a specific parent product (e.g., 160x600). You can change the parent product and time period in this widget.
- **Top Direct Consumed Products** – Displays consumed impressions for the top-performing products across your network or within a specific parent product (e.g., 160x600). This is calculated based on direct and contained consumption. You can change the parent product and time period in this widget.
- **Product Performance** – Displays performance totals across your network, or performance by product within a specific product group. You can change the product group and time period in this widget.

To the left of the widgets is the **Products Tasks** panel, where you can select between four main options for working with products:

- **Find Products** – This accesses the **Find Products** page. This is where you can see see a list of the products across your network, and filter that list based on any number of targeting attributes.
- **Analyze Overlaps** – This accesses the **Audience Planner** page. This is where you can analyze how the audience overlaps between your products.
- **Create a Product** – This accesses the **Product Creation** page. This is where you can create new products based on attributes of existing products and/or a custom set of attributes.
- **Organize Products** – This accesses the **Product Groups Admin** page. This is where you can organize products into groups for easier attribute management and cross-product reporting/analysis.

Below the Product Tasks panel is a read-only summary panel that shows totals for the products included in yield analytics' capacity forecasts.
