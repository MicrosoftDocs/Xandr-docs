# Edit Seller Defaults



You can set the eligibility and inventory trust for sellers in the
Partner Center screen or in the
My Settings for {Seller Name} section
of the Partner Details page.



<b>Note:</b> Inventory trust settings only
apply to standard line item targeting.



Sellers can see the settings you have set for them. Your default
settings will apply if you do not set custom settings for the seller.
For more information on default settings, see
<a href="set-seller-defaults.md" class="xref">Set Seller Defaults</a>.

While you can change your settings for the seller, you cannot change the
seller's settings for you. You can change your settings for the seller
in the Partner Center and in the
My Settings for {Seller Name} section
of the Partner Details page. You can view the seller's current settings
for you in the {Seller Name} Settings for
Me section of the Partner Details page.
