# October 21, 2024 – Microsoft Invest DSP UI Localization

As part of our ongoing commitment to deliver global products and services, the Microsoft Invest DSP platform User Interface is now localized in Japanese. This update simplifies navigation for traders, providing a more intuitive user experience and making it easier to manage complex interfaces and advanced optimizations with localized support.

**Key benefits**:
- Simplified navigation through a fully localized User Interface.
- Streamlined campaign management with localized troubleshooting tools.
- Localized Help documentation to support platform navigation and comprehension. 

> [!NOTE]
> **The following User Interface fields or elements remain unchanged in their original language:**
> - Numbers
> - Names (such as LI, IO, deals, segments, etc.) will not be translated if they're in a language other than Japanese
> - The navigation bar at the top of the page
> - Metric names
