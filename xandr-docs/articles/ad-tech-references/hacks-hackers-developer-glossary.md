# Hacks-Hackers Developer Glossary

<div class="body">

A group called Hacks/Hackers brings together writers and developers.
They have written a glossary, which you may find interesting if you are
new to developer culture. Here is their description:

Confused? So were we, which is why we put together this Hacks/Hackers
Survival Glossary as an explanation of terms that help us understand the
information landscape. This is a crowdsourced document that provides a
guide to technologies involved in modern content distribution,
coordinated by Hacks/Hackers, a grassroots group that brings journalists
and technologists together. Don't know Drupal from Django, API from
Ajax, mashup from metadata? This is the list for you. It's written for
intelligent nontechies in (mostly) plain English. Feel free to
distribute or contribute.
