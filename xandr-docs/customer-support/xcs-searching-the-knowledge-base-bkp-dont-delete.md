# Searching the Knowledge Base

Log in to the [Customer Support Portal](https://help.xandr.com) to access your full case history, knowledge base articles, or request support.

The Support Knowledge Base contains articles that answer common questions and explain how to troubleshoot common issues and perform common tasks. You can browse or search the knowledge base from multiple locations in the Customer Support Portal.

Knowledge base articles often link to the  wiki for more detailed information or more complicated tasks. The wiki provides an exhaustive overview of  concepts and features. It includes product documentation, webinars, and training offerings. The wiki articles open in a new window, so you can navigate between the knowledge base and the wiki by switching from one window to another.

> [!TIP]
> The knowledge base and the wiki are separate accounts. The first time you click on a link to the wiki, you may be prompted to log in with your wiki account.
