# Standard feed

The Log-Level Standard Feed provides data on your managed publishers' and/or your managed advertisers' transacted impressions and the resulting clicks and conversions. The feed contains one row per transacted impression, click, or conversion. If you use impression and click trackers, the feed will also contain one row per impression tracker or click tracker event. For video and audio media types, the feed will also contain one row per video/audio VAST event (see `event_type` in the [Columns](#columns) section below for more information).

The Xandr internal name for this feed is `standard_feed`.

## Sequence

The columns below are listed in the same order in which they appear in the log-level feed file (top to bottom here, left to right in the file).

## Data visibility and "NULL" values

All columns are always included, but you can only see data about your own transacted impressions. The "Visibility" column tells you who sees a particular column in any given transaction (e.g., both buyers and sellers, just buyers, or just sellers). Columns that are not visible will be shown as "NULL."

"NULL" may be returned in cases when:

- You are a buyer in the transaction but the field is a seller-related field (or vice versa).
- The seller on the impression has visibility settings that hide the value of that field from buyers (assuming you are a buyer in this transaction).
- The data is not available.

## Recommended precisions / Lengths of data types

In the [Columns](#columns) table below, some values in the **Type** column contain a recommended precision or length in parentheses. For example, `string(100)` means "this string is probably (but not guaranteed to be) less than or equal to 100 characters in length".

For integers, the sizes are described in the [Integer Key](#integer-key) section.

For `numeric` (floating point) data types, we recommend being able to accept a precision of (18,6), meaning that we expect there to be a maximum total of 18 digits: 12 to the left of the decimal point, and 6 to the right.

For `string` data types, the recommended length of the field varies depending on the field. See the [Columns](#columns) table below.

> [!WARNING]
> These are Recommendations, not Guarantees:
>
> The data *types* are meant to be accurate as documented. However, the recommended *precision* or *length* for a given data type should not be read as a guarantee. For example, a string or numeric column's value may exceed the suggested length or precision listed on this page.
>
> The recommendations are intended to help you build your system to ingest this data. You may need to do additional processing on the output of the Standard Feed to make it work with your particular integration.

Possible values of the `imp_type` field and the affect on the value of the `buyer_member_id` field are listed below: <br> - if the `imp_type` field is `1` (Blank), then the `buyer_member_id` and `creative_id` is `0`. <br> - if the `imp_type` field is `2` (PSA), then the `buyer_member_id` field is set to the Xandr PSA `member_id`. <br> - if the `imp_type` field is `3` (Default Error) or `4` (Default), then the `buyer_member_id` field is set to the value of the `seller_member_id`. <br> - if the `imp_type` field is `5`, `6`, or `7`, then the `buyer_member_id` field is set to the ID of the member who bought the impression. | Both |
