## New Guaranteed Delivery Augmented Line Item (GDALI)

Xandr now offers a Guaranteed Delivery Augmented
Line Item (GDALI) that is based on Xandr's
Augmented Line Item (ALI) and associated with the Seamless Insertion
Order. The new GDALI offers similar features to the legacy guaranteed
delivery line item (GDLI), but by consolidating onto the ALI framework,
we have improved the feature set available for guaranteed delivery and
provided a more intuitive workflow and user experience. For more
information on the introduction of GDALIs, see

## Guaranteed Delivery

For direct-sold business, where sales has secured an insertion order
from a buyer with a committed impression volume, the most important
performance indicator is that the line item delivers its budget in full
and evenly across its flight dates. We call this type of line item
a Guaranteed Delivery (or "Guaranteed") Line Item, and it has the
following properties:

- Delivers budget in full across its flight dates.
- Delivers budget evenly across its flight dates.
- Delivers on guaranteed goals while still (optionally) competing in the
  auction with other demand such as RTB, a feature made possible with
  Open Dynamic Allocation (for more information, see
  <a href="open-dynamic-allocation-and-flexible-priorities.html"
  class="xref">Open Dynamic Allocation and Flexible Priorities</a>).

## Delivery Types

GDALIs have the following delivery types that determine how they will be
prioritized in an auction:

- Impressions – GDALIs with this delivery type have impression-based
  goals, which they will attempt to meet while pacing evenly throughout
  the day (or daypart). They typically have priorities ranging from
  11-17.
- Exclusive – GDALIs with this delivery type have percentage-based goals
  and have the highest priorities possible, typically ranging from
  18-20. They will attempt to serve the scheduled percentage of total
  impressions where their targeting matches and they are eligible to
  serve.

For examples of how GDALIs with these delivery types behave in auctions,
