# Digital Platform API - Creative Macro Check service

If you are running third party creatives, you can use this service to allow Xandr to check third party tags and append parameters in the query string, replace the domain, or insert Xandr click tracking macros in the appropriate place for you. We currently support the following ad servers: MediaMind, Atlas, Fetchback, and DoubleClick.

If we are able to insert the Xandr macros, then the new tag or URL will be returned in the response. If we are unable to ensure that the right macro was inserted (the value in the `existing_other_macros` or `unmatched` fields is not 0 within the response), then the value within the `new_content` or `new_media_url` field will not be displayed in the UI.

## REST API

| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `PUT` | [https://api.appnexus.com/creative-macro-check](https://api.appnexus.com/creative-macro-check)<br>(replace_pattern_in_content_url JSON) | Replace content within a URL based on predefined patterns. |
| `PUT` | [https://api.appnexus.com/creative-macro-check?include_tests=1](https://api.appnexus.com/creative-macro-check?include_tests=1)<br>(replace_pattern_in_content_url JSON) | Replace content within a URL based on predefined patterns and test patterns. |

## JSON fields

| `new_media_url` | string | **Field is populated when modifying a media URL. The updated media URL where all non-secure macros have been evaluated.** This field will contain the same value as `media_url` unless all Xandr macros are successfully inserted. |
| `new_media_url_secure` | string | **Field is populated when modifying a media URL. The updated media URL where all macros, secure and non-secure, have been evaluated.** This field will contain the same value as `media_url` unless all Xandr macros are successfully inserted. |
| `recognized_servers` | array of strings | The names of the adservers that contain a URL pattern matching the value within the `content` or `media_url` field. See Macro Replacements below for more information. |
| `found_urls` | int | The number of 'src=' or 'href=' URLs found in the creative content. |
| `matched_urls` | int | The number of `found_urls` that are from a recognized ad server. |
| `macro_replacements` | array | An array with information about replacements that were done, listed out by macro type (e.g., cachebuster). See Macro Replacements below for more information. |

## Macro replacements

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|

| `replaced` | int | The number of URLs that had a macro for that `type` successfully inserted. |

## Examples

### Replace macros within a third-party tag (content)

The content field can include multiple URLs, however in this example the content field only contains one URL.

```
{code}
$ cat /tmp/replace-macros-in-tag.json

{
    "creative-macro-check": {
        "content": "<a href=\"https://clk.atdmt.com/CCC/go/329458985/direct/01">test</a>"
    }
}

$ curl -b cookies -X PUT -d '@/tmp/replace-macros-in-tag.json' "https://api.appnexus.com/creative-macro-check"
