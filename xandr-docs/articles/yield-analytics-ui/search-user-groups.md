# Search User Groups



If you have administrative permissions, you can quickly search for user
groups by group name, username, or permission. For example, you may want
to find all user groups to which a certain username belongs, or you may
want to find all groups that have permissions for a particular feature.

1.  On the Admin Tools menu,
    click Permissions. The Permissions
    page appears, displaying the Groups panel with a table of all
    existing user groups.
2.  In the Search panel on the left side of the page, type your criteria
    for the groups you want to find as follows:
    - To search for groups by name, type a value in
      the Group Name field.
    - To search for groups that contain a specific username, type a
      value in the User Name field.
    - To search for groups with access to a specific feature, type a
      value in the Permission (Feature
      Name): field.
    - To search for multiple values in a single field, separate the
      values with a semicolon (e.g., to search for all groups that
      contain "ad" or "ops," type `ad;ops`).
3.  Click Search. The Groups panel is redisplayed to show only the
    groups that meet your search criteria.
