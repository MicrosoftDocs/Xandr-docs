Details page.

Step 1. Get Started

Go to the Partner Center screen
(Partners

Buyers tab, and click the
My Profile button to open the
My Seller Profile dialog. Basic
information about your member displays:

- ID - The unique identification
  number for your member.
- Name - Your member name.
- Partner Type - The type of member
  you are within Monetize:
  - Buyer - A member that buys
    inventory through Microsoft Monetize.
  - Seller - A member that sells
    inventory through Microsoft Monetize.

Networks viewing this information can toggle between the buyer and
seller view.

Step 2. Update your profile

Complete the following fields:

- Contact Name - Enter the name of the
  primary contact.
- Contact Title - Enter the business
  title of the primary contact.
- Phone - Enter the primary contact's
  phone number.
- Email - Enter the primary contact's
  email address. A notification is sent to this address when the buyer
  posts a new message in the Activity Stream.

  company's web site.

  mailing address for the primary contact.
- City - Enter the city in which the

  code in which the primary contact is located.

  information about your company that may be relevant.
- Use the same information for my buyer
  profile - Select this checkbox to use this same information
  when a seller is viewing your buyer profile in the
  Partner Center screen.
- Inventory Trust chart - View an
  overview of the audit quality of your inventory. You can see the
  number of impressions as well as the percentage of your inventory that
  has been self-audited (**Seller-reviewed**) or audited by
  Xandr (**Platform-reviewed**). The statistics
  for **All** inventory will include your audited and unaudited
  inventory.

Step 3. Record your changes

When all changes have been made, click
Save at the bottom of the dialog. Your
changes are saved and you are returned to the
