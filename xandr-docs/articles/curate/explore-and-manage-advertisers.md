# Explore and Manage Advertisers





The Advertisers screen is a management
screen that shows you essential metrics about all your advertisers,
provides quick access to each advertiser's details and child objects,
and reporting options.

Managing Advertisers

- To reach the Advertisers screen,
  select Package
   \>  Advertisers in
  the menu bar.
- To edit an advertiser, hover over the row for the advertiser you want
  to edit and then click the pencil icon.
- To activate or deactivate an advertiser, check the box for each
  advertiser you want to activate or deactivate and click
  Activate or
  Deactivate.
- To delete an advertiser, check the box next to each advertiser you
  want to delete and click Delete.
  

  Warning: Deleting an advertiser
  deletes all of its child objects as well, including insertion orders,
  line items, campaigns, creatives, conversion pixels, and segments. The
  deletions are permanent and cannot be reverted. Although deleted
  objects continue to be available in reporting, you will no longer have
  visibility into their specific settings (revenue budget for line
  items, cost budget and targeting for campaigns, etc.).

  

Viewing Metrics

The metrics on the Advertisers screen
help you assess the performance and delivery of your advertisers at a
glance. These metrics are faster and more readily accessed than via
standard reporting; whereas reporting requires you to submit a request
and then wait for a response, these stats are cached on a regular basis
and are shown whenever you open the Advertisers screen.

Because these stats are dependent upon reporting data and are synced
after reporting has closed for any given hour, for a small chunk of time
each hour, there may be discrepancies between reporting and the grid
data. For more details, see
<a href="availability-of-reporting-data.html" class="xref">Availability
of Reporting Data</a>.



Tip: To sort your advertisers by any
statistic, click on the relevant column.



Columns

The following stats are shown for each advertiser. Note that the data
always reflects the currently selected stats interval:

- **ID**  
  The unique identifier of advertiser.
- **Ins Orders**  
  Number of insertion orders under the advertiser.
- **Line Items**  
  Number of line items under the advertiser.

Viewing Advertiser Details

Viewing Child Objects

The **Ins Orders**, **Line Items**, and
**Campaigns** columns show you the
number of insertion orders (if used), line items, and campaigns below
each advertiser. You can click on these numbers to navigate to the
complete list of objects with their stats.

Filtering Details

The Advanced Filters menu lets you
filter for advertisers based on State, Advertiser Name, and External
Code. You can select Inactive or
Active from the
**State** menu. Click on
Apply or
Apply and Save As. The
Apply and Save As option will save
your filter for future purpose. You can also select
Active filter from
Select a Setting menu, so only
active advertisers are listed. Note that inactive advertisers are shown
with names, IDs, and stats in italics.

Searching by Name/ID

You can use the search field at the top of the screen to find all
advertisers whose names or IDs include a specific string of characters
or numbers.

Reporting on Advertisers

You can initiate a Network Analytics report for one or more advertisers
directly from the Advertisers screen.
Check the box for each advertiser that you want to report on and click
Run Report.

This takes you to the Network Analytics report, where the advertisers
you selected are set as filters.
