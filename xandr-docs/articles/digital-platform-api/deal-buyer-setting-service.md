# Deal buyer setting service

The Deal Buyer Setting Service lets buyers give deals an internal alias for clarity in the UI and assign a status to deals so buyers have more control over which deals theyâ€™re targeting. Note that these deal settings are only available to the buyers who created them and are not visible to the seller of the deal.

> [!NOTE]
> Buyers can use the [Deal Buyer Access Saervice](./deal-buyer-access-service.md) to view the deals available to them and the `deal_targets`field in the [Profile Service](./profile-service.md) to target them. Sellers can use the [Deal Service](./deal-service.md) to set up and manage deals.

## Examples

### Add deal setting

If a deal-buyer-setting object has already been created for the deal, the POST request will return the following error message: "`The buyer_member_id, deal_id combination was not unique.`" To modify this deal-buyer-setting, first make a `GET` [https://api.appnexus.com/deal-buyer-setting?deal_id=DEAL_ID](https://api.appnexus.com/deal-buyer-setting?deal_id=DEAL_ID) request to return the deal-buyer-setting ID. Then use the deal-buyer-setting ID with a `PUT` [https://api.appnexus.com/deal-buyer-setting?id=ID](https://api.appnexus.com deal-buyer-setting?id=ID) request to modify the deal-buyer-setting.
