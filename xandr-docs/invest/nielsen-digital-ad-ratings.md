# Measure demographic targeting success with Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings

When creating or editing an augmented line item, you have the option to enable Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings (DAR), which will measure your line item's performance in reaching its targeted demographic group.

Microsoft Invest allows you to [activate Nielsen DAR for your line item](activate-nielsen-digital-ad-ratings-for-a-line-item.md) to gain insight on the demographics of your targeted audiences. At a $0.30 CPM, Nielsen DAR provides demographic measurements on your line items' targeted audiences. [Nielsen DAR's demographic metrics](nielsen-dar-metrics.md) are especially useful for digital video buyers who wish to measure advertising effectiveness using industry-standard metrics across both TV and digital channels.

> [!NOTE]
> Nielsen DAR has no effect on your line item's targeting and performance.

Nielsen DAR is available when targeting desktop and mobile audiences within the following countries or regions: Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Puerto Rico, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, TÃ¼rkiye, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, and the United States.

<!-- > [!NOTE]
> CTV and computer device types are only measurable when targeting audiences in the United States. -->

Activating Nielsen DAR gives you access to two exclusive advertiser reports: the [Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings - Audience Profile Report](nielsen-dar-audience-profile-report.md) and the [Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings - Site/Split Report](nielsen-dar-site-split-report.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Nielsen DAR is subject to the European Union's **General Data Protection Regulation** (GDPR), so line items with Nielsen DAR tracking enabled won't bid in situations where users haven't given consent to Nielsen, as mandated by the GDPR's **Transparency and Consent Framework**.

## Nielsen DAR

Nielsen DAR provides demographic tracking for ads served on connected devices with Roku, Amazon, Samsung, and Hulu. It also takes into account "co-viewing," when members of the same household are watching simultaneously.

<!-- > [!NOTE]
> Nielsen DAR can only track CTV ads in the United States.

Here's how Nielsen tracks through CTV partners:

1. Nielsen sends Nielsen DAR tags to its CTV partners.
1. CTV partners provide subscriber data to Experian, a consumer reporting company.
1. Experian assigns demographic data to the received subscriber data.
1. Nielsen calibrates Experian's demographic data.
1. Nielsen DAR users receive the data on the CTV ads' reached audiences. -->

## Nielsen DAR use cases

- Validate your current demographic data against Nielsen's reliable and widely used data.
- Standardize measurements between your traditional TV and digital video advertising to better compare their effectiveness.
