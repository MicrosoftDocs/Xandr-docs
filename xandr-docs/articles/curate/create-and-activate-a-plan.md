# Create and Activate a Plan



From the Plan
menu, you can create a plan that lets you experiment with
deal line item targeting settings, understand
inventory availability and reach, and seamlessly create a line item from
your completed plan.



This page provides instructions on creating and activating a plan for
your curated deal. To create a plan, log into
your account on our Microsoft Curate platform.



<b>Note:</b> To achieve accurate forecasting
results, Planner needs to be able to match a minimum number of
impressions or users to the plan's targeting criteria. If the plan
yields too small a number of impression or user matches, Planner
displays an error rather than attempting to provide forecasting data.







1.  Click the
    Plan
    menu.
    

    The Planning screen is
    displayed, showing any already-configured plans. You can select any
    plan to edit it, duplicate it, or create and activate a
    deal line item based on it.

    
2.  Click Daily,
    Weekly, or
    Full Flight at the top of the
    right pane if you want to change the scope of the plan. Selecting
    Full Flight lets you choose
    specific start and end dates.
3.  If you clicked Full
    Flight, select start and end dates on the
    Setup tab in the left
    pane.
4.  In the
    Setup pane, enter your
    CPM,
    Advertiser,
    Supply, and
    Ad Type details.
    

    When you click Generate Plan, Planner populates the right pane with
    information about the available inventory and predicted delivery
    based on your pre-targeting settings.

    
5.  If your account is enabled to take a margin,
    you can check Margin Eligible to
    limit the available inventory only to inventory that is margin
    eligible.
6.  Select the
    Targeting tab and experiment
    with settings to see how applying targeting changes the affected
    availability and delivery for your plan. 
    

    You can use the graphs to identify where inventory is available, so
    you can target a specific audience without risking non-delivery of
    your ads.

    
7.  Click Save to
    save your plan or Cancel to cancel
    your selections.
8.  To activate a plan by creating a new
    deal line item, click
    Create Deal Line Item. 
    

    Curate opens the deal
    line item settings for a new line item based on the
    information in your plan. Your new deal line
    item won't serve until you have set it to be active (it will be
    inactive by default) and saved it.
    

    <b>Note:</b> You can also activate a plan
    from the Planning screen's
    list view by selecting the plan and clicking
    Create Deal Line Item at the top
    right of the screen.
