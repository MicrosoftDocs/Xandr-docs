# Bidders - user service

Here "user" refers to people or groups using Xandr's APIs. The User Service will allow you to
manage who has access to Xandr's APIs. Users are classified as by a user type of either *bidder* or *member*.

- Bidder users can be created by other bidder users.
- A bidder-user can create and update member-users as well as update its own user info.
- A member-user can update its own user info.
- Each new username associated with a particular bidder must be unique.

## Examples

**Authentication token**

Authentication is always the first step when using the API Services. The authentication token can then be written to our cookie file for future use. Please see [Authentication Service](authentication-service.md) for more detailed instructions.

**Create a user profile text file**

To give API access to "TestUser," you will create a text file in JSON format with the username and password of the user, and the ID of either a member or bidder to which this user will belong. Below we have used
the "cat" command to output an example user JSON file.

```
$ cat user
{
   "user":{
      "username":"TestUser",
      "password":"2323test",
      "entity_id":7,
          "email": "user1@examplecompany.com",
          "user_type": "bidder"
   }
}
```

**Guidelines for creating your password**

When creating your password, please create a complex password with the
following:

- 10 or more characters
- 64 or fewer characters
- At least one capital letter (A–Z)
- At least one lowercase letter (a–z)
- At least one digit (0–9)
- At least one special character (such as \#, $, ? %, &)

**Add a new user to the Imp Bus cache**

Now we will input the user file. We have used cookies to authenticate
ourselves.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST --data-binary @user https://api.adnxs.com/user
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "id":59
   }
}
```

**Retrieve user information from the Imp Bus cache**

We know from the output of the above command that the user we just added
has been assigned ID \#59 by the Imp Bus. We can use that ID to view
information about this particular user. To see all users that we have
created, we would leave off the user ID.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies https://api.adnxs.com/user/59
{
  "response": {
    "status": "OK",
    "count": 1,
    "start_element": null,
    "num_elements": null,
    "user": {
      "id": 59,
      "active": true,
      "first_name": null,
      "last_name": null,
      "phone": null,
      "username": "TestUser",
      "email": "user1@examplecompany.com",
      "user_type": "bidder",
      "read_only": false,
      "api_login": false,
      "entity_id": 7,
      "publisher_id": null,
      "advertiser_id": null,
      "custom_data": null,
      "send_safety_budget_notifications": false,
      "entity_name": "Platform Services Test Bidder",
      "timezone": null,
      "entity_reporting_decimal_type": null,
      "reporting_decimal_type": null,
      "decimal_mark": "period",
      "thousand_separator": "comma",
      "last_modified": "2017-02-16 19:06:47",
      "is_developer": false,
      "role_id": null,
      "languages": null,
      "advertiser_access": null,
      "publisher_access": null
    },
    "dbg": {
                ...
    }
  }
}
```

**Request API access**

Notice in the returned code above the **api_login** field. This field can only be changed by a Xandr administrator. The final step in giving a user access to the API is to contact customer support and request that the **api_login** flag for the user be set to **true**. Be sure to include username or ID in the request.
