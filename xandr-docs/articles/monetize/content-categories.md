# Content Categories



Content categories are metadata attached to a slice of inventory that
describe the contents of that inventory. This makes it easier for buyers
to research and to buy. Content categories can also make selling to your
potential customers easier as they can buy across a whole category
instead of targeting individual chunks of it.

There are two types of content categories:

- **Universal:** These categories are maintained by
  Xandr.
- **Custom:** Sellers have the ability to define their own categories
  and apply them to slices of their own inventory.



<b>Tip:</b> We are splitting our "Automotive
and Vehicles" category into sub-categories for dealerships,
manufacturers, service, and more. For more information, see
<a href="automotive-content-categories.md" class="xref">Automotive
Content Categories</a>.



Apply Categories to Your Inventory

You can apply a number of categories to each of your sites and
placements at the Network, Site, and Placement
levels. For instructions, see
<a href="create-a-placement.md" class="xref">Create a Placement</a>.

Expose Categories for Targeting by Buyers

To expose content categories for targeting by buyers, see the sections
on **targeting access** for content categories on the
<a href="partner-center-screen-seller-view.md" class="xref">Partner
Center Screen - Seller View</a> and <a
href="edit-buyer-eligibility-allowed-payment-types-and-targeting-access.md"
class="xref">Partner Controls</a> page.

**Report on Volume by Category**


You can report on inventory volumes broken down by universal content
category using the <a href="universal-content-categories-report.md"
class="xref">Universal Content Categories Report</a>.



<b>Note:</b> There is currently no way to
report on inventory volumes broken down by **custom** categories.





Target Categories with Your Campaigns

Here are the campaign targeting rules as applied to content categories:

- When you target more than one category, the categories have an **OR**
  relationship. This means that if a slice of inventory is in either
  category, it will match your campaign's targeting.
- Content categories have an **AND** relationship with other inventory
  targeting options. For example, if you are targeting a universal
  content category of News coming from the Microsoft inventory source,
  your campaign will only bid on placements coming from Microsoft that
  have been categorized as News. This is an example of a set of
  targeting parameters that are unlikely to match. Be careful when you
  set up campaign targeting parameters with **AND** relationships since
  it's possible to seriously reduce your campaign's reach (or even keep
  from serving altogether).

<a href="content-category-targeting.md" class="xref">Content Category
Targeting</a>.

Universal Content Categories List

Below is a list of universal content categories and subcategories we
maintain. The most up-to-date list will always be available in the
**Campaign Manager** under the
Inventory tab. For more information,
