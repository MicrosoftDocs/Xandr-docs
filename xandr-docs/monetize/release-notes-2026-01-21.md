# DV360 Central Partner ID Support for Multi-Buyer Deals

**Release date:** January 21, 2026  
**Product:** Microsoft Monetize and Curate<br>
**Area:** Deals  


Microsoft Monetize and Curate now fully support targeting **DV360 Central Partner IDs**, enabling streamlined and DV360-compliant multi-buyer deal workflows.

This enhancement restores multi-buyer deal functionality with DV360 buyers while significantly reducing operational complexity.



## What’s New

- You can now create **a single deal** that is automatically eligible for **all DV360 Partner IDs** associated with a selected **Central Partner ID**.
- Deal permissions are managed directly within **Display & Video 360 (DV360)**, eliminating the need for manual buyer seat listing.
- Supports DV360’s latest buying standards for agency and buying-group deal execution.



## Why This Matters

- **Greater Scale & Efficiency**  
  Consolidated deal management reduces the number of deals to create and maintain.

- **Improved Demand Access**  
  Deals targeted to a Central Partner ID are automatically available to all associated buyers, unlocking incremental demand.

- **Future-Ready & Compliant**  
  Aligns with DV360’s current deal-buying model and supports agency-level buying strategies.



## How to Use It

When creating deals for DV360 buyers:

1. In **Buyer Selection**, choose the **Central Partner ID** provided by the buyer.
2. Confirm whether you are targeting:
   - A **single Partner ID**, or  
   - A **Central Partner ID** (multi-buyer scope).
3. Each deal can target **only one Central Partner ID**.


## Reporting & Measurement

- Individual buyers bidding on the deal appear in most reports.  
  Use the following dimensions:
  - **Buyer Seat Name**
  - **Buyer Seat Code**

- The **Seller Deal Metrics** report displays the **Central Partner ID** targeted in the deal.

- To view buyer-level performance breakdowns, use the **Multi-Buyer Seller Deal Metrics** report with:
  - **Buyer Seat Name**
  - **Buyer Seat Code**
