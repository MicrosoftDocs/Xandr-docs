# Bidders - Creative search service

This read-only service allows you to search for creatives based on specific criteria such as audit status, ID, size, etc. To add creatives to the system, see the [Creative Service](creative-service.md).

> [!WARNING]
> Since this service searches all creatives on Xandr's platform (not just your own), a search that is too broad might cause an error. To ensure that you get results, please narrow your search as much as possible.

## Implementation

### REST API

| HTTP method | End point | Description |
|--|--|--|
| POST | `[https://api..com/creative-search](https://api..com/creative-search)` (creative_search JSON) | To search for creatives. |
| POST | `[https://api..com/creative-search?sort=FIELD_NAME.ASC_OR_DESC](https://api..com/creative-search?sort=FIELD_NAME.ASC_OR_DESC)` (creative_search JSON) | Search for creatives and sort results. <br> **Note**: The fields used to search for creatives are not exactly the same as the fields returned. This is because the returned objects are drawn from the [Creative Service](creative-service.md) and formatted accordingly. This service will only search active creatives. |

## JSON fields

| Field | Type | Sort? | Use |
|--|--|--|--|
| `ad_profile_id` | int | No | **Must be used with** `brand_status`. Search for a creative by the ID of its ad profile. |
| `audit_status` | array of enums | Yes | Search for creatives by their audit status. Possible values: "no_audit", "pending", "rejected", "audited". |
| `brand_ids` | array of integers | No | Search for creatives by the IDs of their brands. |
| `brand_status` | array of enums | No | **Must be used with** `ad_profile_id`. Search for creatives by their brand status. For example, if this is set to "trusted", all trusted brands within the ad profiles specified in `ad_profile_id` will be returned in the response. Possible values: "trusted", "case-by-case", "banned". The brand status field is only returned in the response when you use this filter. |
| `click_url` | string | Yes | **Not a filter**. Sort results in ascending/descending alphabetical click URL order. |
| `creative_ids` | array of integers | Yes, use "id" in query string. | Search for creatives by their IDs. |
| `description` | string | No | Search for creatives by terms in their descriptions. |
| `formats` | array of enums | Yes, use "format" in query string. | Search for creatives by their formats. Possible values: "url-html", "url-js", "flash", "image", "raw-js", "raw-html", "iframe-html", "url-vast", "text". |
| `landing_page_url` | string | Yes | **Not a filter**. Sort results in ascending/descending alphabetical landing page URL order. |
| `media_content` | string | No | Search for a creative by the data in its original_content field (see [Creative Service](creative-service.md)). |
| `media_subtype` | array of enums | No | **Deprecated**, **use** `media_subtype_ids` instead. Search for creatives by their media subtypes. Possible values: "Banner", "Popup", "Popunder". |
| `media_subtype_ids` | array of integers | Yes, use "media_subtype_id" in query string. | Search for creatives by their media subtype via ID. You can use the [Media Subtype Service](../digital-platform-api/media-subtype-service.md) to look up the desired IDs. |
| `media_url` | string | Yes | Search for a creative by its URL. |
| `member_action` | enum | No | **Must be used with** `member_ids`. If this is set to "exclude", you exclude the members specified in `member_ids` from the search. Otherwise, the specified IDs are included. |
| `member_ids` | array of integers | Yes, use "member_id" in query string. | **Must be used with** `member_action`. Search for creatives by the IDs of their members. |
| `modified_since` | timestamp | No | Search for creatives that were modified since this date. Format: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS". |
| `review_status` | array of enums | No | Search for creatives based on their review status (from the associated ad profiles). Possible values: "reviewed", "unreviewed". The review status field is only returned in the response when you use this filter. |
| `size_in_bytes` | string | Yes | **Not a filter**. Sort results in ascending/descending size order. |
| `sizes` | array of strings | Yes, use "width" and "height" in query string. | Search for creatives by their sizes, for example, "728x90". |
| `template_id` | int | Yes | Search for creatives by their creative template IDs. |
