# The Universal Pixel



The universal pixel provides insights into the interactions that users
have with your website, so you can easily segment these users and
measure the value of the actions they take. By providing a central
configuration interface and unified pixel code, the universal pixel
removes the need to separately define conversion pixels and segment
pixels.

The universal pixel is implemented by placing the code within the head
tag (\<head\> ... \</head\>) of your advertiser's website. You can
analyze user traffic in three different ways in order to segment users
and track conversions:

- Track the referrer URL of the page the pixel was loaded from
- Track Standard events which can be fired based on user actions on a
  page
- Track additional metadata that's passed using a parameter along with a
  standard event

To set up the pixel, you'll create the pixel code, deploy it on your
website, see the activity reflected in the Xandr
UI, and then do any further segment and conversion configuration to
refine your data collection process. After you set up segments, you can
also target them from your line items. For the complete setup workflow,

Setting up the basic implementation requires you to set up the Universal Pixel object in Monetize, deploy the script code containing the pixel ID on your website, and check your pixel activity on the Activity tab in the Universal Pixels page.">Universal

Note: You can only define one universal
pixel per advertiser. Also, while you can reconfigure or rename the
pixel after you create it, you cannot delete it.
