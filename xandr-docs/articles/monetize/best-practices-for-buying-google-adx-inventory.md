# Best Practices for Buying Google Ad Manager Inventory



This page provides recommendations for maximum ad campaign success when
targeting Google Ad Manager inventory.

General

The following are general guidelines to target inventory:

- Create a separate line item or campaign
  targeting Google Ad Manager(181). This is recommended, but not
  required.
- Make sure to turn off all inventory quality settings by setting your
  **Inventory Quality** Targeting to **Serve on any inventory**.
- The VAST tag must include the following formats since Google Ad
  Manager can request any of them on a bid request:
  - H.264 (MP4)
  - FlashVideo (FLV)
  - WebM
- The skip offset must be 5 seconds, otherwise the bid will be filtered
  out in Google Ad Manager's auction.

Creative Guidelines

The following are guidelines specific to creative standards required for
Google Ad Manager:

- Must be SSL compliant. Serving on secure inventory is selected by
  default. Do NOT make any changes to the setting when you are creating
  a new creative.

- Click the Run Check button to have
  our VAST check scan your XML document. For more details, see
  <a href="vast-check.html" class="xref">VAST Check</a>.

Campaign Targeting

- Category targeting is possible for video, but it is not reflected in
  reporting.

- You can target Google Ad Manager inventory by position, but it is NOT
  recommended. In the Video section
  under Targeting, leave the default
  **Any position** selected.
