# Microsoft Invest - Peer approval

Peer Approval provides a way for you to ensure that augmented line items are reviewed and approved by a second user before they can be set to active. This allows you to catch any possible setup errors before the line item starts spending.

The Peer Approval feature is not activated for all clients. If you want to have your account enabled for the Peer Approval feature, contact your account representative.

## User settings

To designate that a user must receive approval for any line items they create before they can set them to Active, select the **User must have peer approval** checkbox on the user's account. This will cause an **Approval Status** field to appear on all line items they create.

## Line item creation workflow

For all line items created by a user who is required to request peer approval, the **Approval Status** field will initially be set to Pending. The line item's **State** field can not be set to Active until the **Approval Status** field is set to Approved.

Line items with **Approval Status** set to Pending must be reviewed by a user other than the creator of the line item. Once reviewed, the line item can either be Rejected (with comments explaining what corrections need to be made) or Approved.

- If the line item's **Approval Status** is set to **Rejected**, the changes suggested by the Approver must be made and saved. The line item's **Approval Status** will be reset to **Pending**.
- If the line item's **Approval Status** is set to **Approved**, the line item's **Status** field can be set to **Active**.

  | Line Item status | Approval Status | Next action required | Who can perform the action |
  |--|--|--|--|
  | Inactive | Rejected | The line item must be corrected to address the reasons for rejection. Once these changes are made and saved, the **Approval Status** will be reset to Pending. | Any user (with line item edit permissions) |
  | Inactive | Pending | Line item must be reviewed and marked as Rejected or Approved. | Any user (with line item edit permissions) who did not create the line item |
  | Inactive | Not Required | No review of the line item is needed because the user who created it does not have the **Approval Status** checkbox selected in their user profile. The line item **Status** field can be set to **Active** at any time. | N/A |
  | Inactive | Approved | The line item **Status** field can be set to Active. | Any user (with line item edit permissions) |
