# Deal Best Practices for Buyers



This page provides some basic best practices for buyers using the new
deal functionality.

Getting Started with Deals

Start slow

For buyers that are new to our deals feature,
Xandr recommends working with sellers you trust
to develop a few test deals. Use and refine these test deals to learn
what works best for you and your sellers before targeting a creating a
lot of ad campaigns that target deals.

Deal Delivery

Deal delivery expectations

- A deal does not guarantee delivery. Be prepared for low-reach deals.
- Avoid setting your end client's expectations about delivery on any
  specific deal. Low delivery should be expected to some extent. A deal
  contains a small slice of inventory. Add the fact that there may be
  other buyers competing for the deal, and low delivery is
  understandable.
- Targeting a deal guarantees you will be targeting a specific pool of
  inventory. Having a deal, even a private auction deal, does NOT
  guarantee you will win all of that inventory. Sellers generally expose
  deals to multiple buyers. Therefore, as with all other RTB, there are
  other buyers competing for the deal inventory.

Targeting deals so that they deliver

- If you are not winning as much of the deal inventory as you would
  like, bid higher to beat the other buyers. Or include more deals in
  your targeting to create a larger pool of inventory.
- Avoid advanced targeting settings. These settings should only be used
  for targeting broad deals. For example, targeting a broad buyer-owned
  segment within a deal that covers a seller's entire network could
  produce some available impressions. For deals that contain a limited
  pool of inventory, applying additional targeting settings may limit
  delivery to zero.
- Targeting multiple deals that apply to the same inventory in a single
  line item or campaign is not recommended. When
  a single line item or campaign bids on an
  impression where two deals apply, the system will choose the deal with
  the lowest ID. You can not define which deal you would like to apply.
- When setting up your deal line item or
  campaign, the system will calculate a Suggested Minimum Bid.
  This is the minimum you must bid in order to participate in the
  auction. However, bidding this amount does not mean that you will win
  the
  auction.

- Deal impressions face competition from other buyers. In order to win
  the impression, your bid needs to be both higher than the deal ask
  price, and higher than bids from other buyers.
- Deal line item or campaign setup is similar to
  non-deal setup. Often, you'll experience under-delivery due to
  budgeting, pacing, or other issues that are not related to the fact
  that you are targeting a deal.

Identifying High Performance Deals

Target multiple deals within a single line item or
campaign and then use
<a href="buy-side-reporting-on-deals.md" class="xref">Buy-Side
Reporting on Deals</a> to see which deals perform best. Then create a
new line item or campaign to target the deals
that work best.

Deals with External Sellers

Rubicon REVV Connect

- Each deal ID can only be associated with a single deal price. Enter
  one price when setting up a deal in REVV Connect. If multiple prices
  are entered, Xandr will only map the deal to
  the highest possible price.
- Each deal ID can only be associated with a single buyer. Enter one
  buyer member when setting up a deal in REVV Connect. If multiple
  members are entered, Xandr will only map the
  deal to the first buyer member.
- Deals with a price in a foreign currency may drift from the
  agreed-upon price as the exchange rate fluctuates. On the day the deal
  is synchronized with Xandr, Rubicon converts
  the deal price to USD. Rubicon does not refresh the deal price with
  updated daily exchange rates. It will remain static and may drift from
  the agreed-upon price in the foreign currency.

PubMatic

- Each deal ID can only be associated with a single buyer. Enter one
  buyer member when setting up a deal in PubMatic. If multiple members
  are entered, Xandr will only map the deal to
  the first buyer member.
