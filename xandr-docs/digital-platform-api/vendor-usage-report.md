# Digital Platform API - Vendor Usage report

This network report provides the details on your usage of data or platform powered by third-party vendors (e.g., user segment providers), the costs of that data or feature usage, and the line items/campaigns where vendor costs were applicable.

- today
- yesterday
- last_7_days
- last_30_days

- last_month
- lifetime

The `time_granularity` of the data is `hourly`. For instructions on retrieving a report, see the [Report Service](report-service.md) or the [Examples](#examples) below.

## Examples

### Create JSON formatted report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` of `"buyer_vendor_usage_analytics"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`month`, `day`, `hour`), and specify the format in which the data should be returned (`csv`, `excel`, or `html`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](report-service.md).

```
$ cat buyer_vendor_usage_analytics  
{
    "report": {
        "report_type": "buyer_vendor_usage_analytics",
        "format": "csv",
        "report_interval": "last_7_days",
        "columns": [
            "imps",
            "line_item_id",
            "vendor_costs",
            "sales_tax",
            "vendor_type",
            "vendor"
        ],
        "orders": [
            "line_item_id",
            "vendor_costs",
            "vendor_type"

    }

### `GET` the report status from the Report service

Make a `GET` call with the report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is `ready`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```

### `GET` the report data from the Report Download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and report ID in the `url` field of the response to your previous `GET` call. When identifying the file that you want to save, be sure to use the file extension of the file `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST` call, for example, CSV.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=d89151942729f768dcac4586288ff7eb' > /tmp/buyer_vendor_usage_analytics.csv
```

> [!TIP]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `\-i` or `\-v` in your call to expose the response header.
> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
