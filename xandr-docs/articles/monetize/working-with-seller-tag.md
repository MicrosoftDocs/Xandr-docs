# Working with Xandr's Seller Tag (AST)



Xandr's Seller Tag (AST) is a lightweight
JavaScript SDK that consolidates all ad slots on a publisher's web page
to be auctioned and sends information about them in a single ad request
whenever possible.

AST runs in the header or body of a web page in a user's browser and
allows publishers to conduct auctions directly from the page. AST loads
asynchronously, meaning that ad calls do not block the page content from
loading. For more information on AST, see <a
href="seller-tag/seller-tag/seller-tag.md"
class="xref" target="_blank">Seller Tag</a>.

## AST Features

AST provides the following features:

- **Competitive Exclusions** - allow you to prevent creatives with
  competitive brands or offer categories from serving alongside each
  other. Competitive exclusions settings are available at the Advertiser
  and Creative levels. For more information, see
  <a href="competitive-exclusions.md" class="xref"

  Exclusions</a>.
- **Page Caps** - allow you to restrict brands, advertisers, line items,
  or campaigns from winning more than one ad slot per AST ad call.
  Sell-side page caps apply to brands, while buy-side page caps apply to
  advertisers, line items, and campaigns. For more information, see
  <a href="sell-side-page-caps.md" class="xref">Sell-Side Page Caps</a>
  and
  <a href="buy-side-page-caps.md" class="xref">Buy-Side Page Caps</a>.
- **Roadblocks** - allow you to serve multiple creatives together on the
  same page. Roadblocks are only available on managed inventory, where
  you can control the settings on both the buy-side and the sell-side.
