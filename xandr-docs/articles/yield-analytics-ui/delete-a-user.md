# Delete a User



If you have administrative permissions, you can delete user accounts.



Warning: You should only delete users
who have not logged in to yield analytics. To prevent a previously
active user from logging in, disable the user account instead.



1.  On the Admin Tools menu,
    click Users. The Users page
    appears, displaying a list of all user accounts.
2.  In the far right column for the user you want to remove,
    click Delete.
3.  Click OK.
