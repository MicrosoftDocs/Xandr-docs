The cards in **Trader Home** display
essential information about insertion orders important to you. You can
add and remove cards to and from your Trader Home, depending on which
insertion orders you'd like to see.

## Add a card

Use the following steps to add a card:

1. Create the insertion order you want to display in
    **Trader Home**. See [Create an Insertion Order](create-an-insertion-order.md) for more details.
    
    > [!TIP]
    > To display all available card metrics, your insertion order should have a budget and flight dates/billing period(s).

1. On **Trader Home**, click the **Add IOs to
    Home** button and type the name or ID of the insertion order
    you want to add. This will display a list of insertion orders that
    match your search.
1. Click the **Add** button next to the
    insertion order(s) you want to add to
    **Trader Home**. A card will
    display for each added insertion order.

    > [!TIP]
    > Cards can be dragged and dropped into a personalized order. The new order will save and display each time you use **Trader Home**.

## Remove a card

You can remove cards from **Trader
Home**. This is particularly useful when you no longer need to
watch an insertion order, or when you want to get rid of unnecessary or
accidentally added cards. There are two ways to remove a card from
**Trader Home**.

    **settings** button in the top right corner of the card to flip the
    card.

## Remove a card using search

    Home** button and search for the insertion order by name or ID
    number.
