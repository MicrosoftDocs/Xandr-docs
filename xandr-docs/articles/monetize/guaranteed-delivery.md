This page describes features of Guaranteed Delivery line items and how
they work at a high level.

For direct-sold business, where sales has secured an insertion order
from a buyer with a committed impression volume, the most important
performance indicator is that the line item delivers its budget in full
and evenly across its flight dates. We call this type a **Guaranteed
Delivery** (or "guaranteed") line item, and it has the following
properties:

- Delivers budget in full across its flight dates
- Delivers budget evenly across its flight dates
- Delivers on guaranteed goals while still (optionally) competing in the
  auction with other demand such as RTB.

Delivery Types

Guaranteed Delivery line items have the following delivery types that
determine how they will be prioritized in the auction:

- Impressions
- Exclusive

Impressions

Guaranteed line items with the **Impressions** delivery type have
impression-based goals, which they will attempt to meet while pacing
evenly throughout the day (or daypart). They typically have priorities
ranging from 11-17.

Exclusive

Unlike **Impression** guaranteed line items, guaranteed line items with
**Exclusive** delivery types have percentage-based goals and have the
highest priorities possible, typically ranging from 18-20. They will
attempt to serve the scheduled percentage of total impressions where
their targeting matches and they are eligible to serve.
