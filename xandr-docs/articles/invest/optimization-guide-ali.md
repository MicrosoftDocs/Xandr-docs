# Microsoft Invest - Optimization guide - ALI 

Augmented Line Item (ALI) optimization uses sophisticated algorithms to
achieve your advertising goals as efficiently as possible, minimizing
your time investment and maximizing return on ad spend. You tell us your
business model and what you're trying to achieve and, with that
information, we adjust our algorithms and back-end behaviors to achieve
the desired outcome. Specifically, our optimization automatically
manages pacing, budget allocation, inventory discovery, inventory
valuation, and other tasks that software has the ability to do better
than humans.

## In this guide:

[Adaptive Pacing](adaptive-pacing.md): Shade
bids and deliver budgets as efficiently as possible.

[Lifetime Pacing](lifetime-pacing.md): Automatically distribute a budget over the lifespan of a
line item's flight utilizing Xandr's algorithm.

[Discovery](discovery.md): Prioritize the
inventory that is most likely to perform.

[Valuation](valuation.md): Determine how much
to bid.

[Ways to Improve Click-Through Rate (CTR) Performance](ways-to-improve-ctr-performance.md): Improve your line
item's CTR performance, even after setting a CTR optimization goal.
