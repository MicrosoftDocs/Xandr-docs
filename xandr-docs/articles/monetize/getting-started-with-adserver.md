# Getting Started with Adserver



As an Adserver user, you have access to your end-to-end setup of
advertiser and publisher information. You can set up publishers and
available inventory, as well as advertisers and their selling
specifications. This guide will describe some of the functionality
available to you, and link you to the vast number of documentation
resources that can help you quickly and efficiently set up and maintain
your system of buyers and sellers.

With Adserver, you can set up and manage your buy-side systems and your
sell-side systems, as well as manage forecasting, priorities, and many
other types of functionality between the two.

settings are specific to your account, some apply as default settings to
your advertisers and publishers.
