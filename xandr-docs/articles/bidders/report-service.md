# Bidders - Report service

The Report Service offers reporting data of interest to both buyers and sellers. It's used to answer questions such as:

- How much money was spent?
- How many impressions were seen?
- How many impressions were sold?
- How much revenue was earned?

This is a **read-only** service. Although you will `POST` a JSON-formatted report request, this will not alter any data in the Imp Bus cache. You must be authenticated as a `"bidder"` user type to run reports. Each report type provides its own metrics, filtering, and grouping options.

> [!TIP]
> Need more than 90 days of data?
>
> The `platform_buyer` and `platform_seller` report types pull from tables that store the last 90 days worth of data. For older data, please use the `bidder_pricing_report` and `seller_invoice_report` report types.
>
> The Report Service runs reports asynchronously, which means it can run several processes in parallel. When you make a report request, you will either receive the report, an error message, or a pending message. For more information, see [How to Retrieve a Report](#how-to-retrieve-a-report) below.
>
> There is also a graphical user interface (UI) to view this reporting data at [Bidder](https://bidder.xandr.com/). If you do not have access to this UI, contact your Xandr representative.
> [!NOTE]
> The Bidder UI does not expose all functionality that is available via the API. It only exposes the `platform_buyer` analytics report. If you need a different report, you must use the API.

## Report types

The primary report types are:

- [Bidder Platform Buyer Report](bidder-platform-buyer-report.md)
- [Platform Seller Report](platform-seller-report.md)
- [Bidder Billing Report API](bidder-billing-report-api.md)
- [Seller Platform Billing Report](seller-platform-billing-report.md)
- [Completed Creative Audits Report](completed-creative-audits-report.md)
- [Bidder Bid Error Report API](bidder-bid-error-report-api.md)

## REST API for viewing metadata

There are two layers of data in the Report Service - metadata and actual data. Metadata is a list of available reporting parameters.

To run a custom report you will need a JSON-formatted request. You can request data by a filter, group, or column. A filter will filter out results. A request having a filter such as `day`, will filter based on aggregated data. You can also search by individual parameters, such as `imps_sold`.

| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `https://api.adnxs.com/report?meta=buyer_platform_billing` | Return metadata for `bidder_pricing_report` type. |
| GET | `https://api.adnxs.com/report/meta/platform_buyer` | Return metadata for `platform_buyer` type. |
| GET | `https://api.adnxs.com/report/meta/platform_seller` | Return metadata for `platform_seller` type. |
| GET | `https://api.adnxs.com/report/meta/seller_platform_billing` | Return metadata for `seller_invoice_report` type. |

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use a more standard query format to return metadata:
>
> ```
> report?meta=report_type
> ```
>
> For example:
>
> ```
> GET https://api.adnxs.com/report?meta=platform_buyer
> ```
>

Metadata comes in the following format:

```
{"column":"day","type":"time"}
{"column":"month","type":"time"}
{"column":"geo_country","type":"string"}
```

## REST API for data retrieval

| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `https://api.adnxs.com/report/REPORT_ID` | Request the status of a report. |
| GET | `https://api.adnxs.com/report-download/REPORT_ID` | Retrieve report data. |
| POST | `https://api.adnxs.com/report?member_id=MEMBER_ID` <br> (report JSON) | Request a report. |

## JSON fields

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `columns` | yes (at least one) | array | List of columns to include in the report. See the documentation for each individual report to learn which columns are available. For a simple example, see [How to Retrieve a Report](#how-to-retrieve-a-report) below. |
| `end_date` | no | string | The ending date for the report. <br> - For report types that offer hourly data, this must be formatted as `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"`. However, `MM:SS` must be `00:00`, as data is not available for minutes and seconds. <br> - For report types that do not offer hourly data, this must be formatted as `"YYYY-MM-DD"`. <br><br> **Note**: The `end_date` is non-inclusive. For example, if you start a monthly report on "`2012-07-01"` and end the report on `"2012-07-31"`, your report will not include data from the last day of the month. The correct way to retrieve this data would be to end the report on `"2012-08-01"`. |
| `escape_fields` | no | boolean | When `true`, it adds quotes around each field in the report output to allow for safer import into Excel. This only applies to CSV and tab-delimited reports. |
| `filters` | no | array | List of filters to apply to the report. See the documentation for each individual report to see which fields can be filtered on. For a simple example, see [How to Retrieve a Report](#how-to-retrieve-a-report) below. <br><br> **Note**: The `is_delivered` filter value is only `true` if the impression was served successfully. Otherwise, it's `false`. |
| `report_interval` | no | enum | The time range for the report. Not all reports accept all intervals; see each report's documentation and metadata for details. Possible values: <br> - `current_hour` <br> - `last_hour` <br> - `today` <br> - `yesterday` <br> - `last_48_hours` <br> - `last_7_days` <br> - `lifetime` <br> - `month_to_date` <br> - `mtd` <br> - `last_month` |
| `report_type` | yes | enum | Must be one of: <br> - "`platform_buyer`" <br> - "`platform_seller`" <br> - "`bidder_pricing_report`" <br> - "`seller_invoice_report`" <br> - "`completed_creative_audits`" <br> - "`bidder_bid_error_report`" <br> This determines which information will be returned. |
| `row_per` | no | array | List of groupings to include in the report. See the documentation for each individual report to learn which columns can be used to group by. For a simple example, see [How to Retrieve a Report](#how-to-retrieve-a-report) below. |
| `start_date` | no | string | The ending date for the report. <br> - For report types that offer hourly data, this must be formatted as `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"`. However, `MM:SS` must be `00:00`, as data is not available for minutes and seconds. <br> - For report types that do not offer hourly data, this must be formatted as `"YYYY-MM-DD"`. |
| `timezone` | no | string | The timezone in which the data will be reported. For a list of possible timezone values, see [Reporting Timezones](reporting-timezones.md). |

## How to retrieve a report

- [Step 1. Create a JSON-formatted report request](#step-1-create-a-json-formatted-report-request)
- [Step 2. POST the request to the Report Service](#step-2-post-the-request-to-the-report-service)
- [Step 3. GET the report status from the Report Service](#step-3-get-the-report-status-from-the-report-service)
- [Step 4. GET the report data from the Report Download Service](#step-4-get-the-report-data-from-the-report-download-service)

### Step 1. Create a JSON-formatted report request

The JSON file should include the specific `report_type` that you want to run, as well as the `columns` (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` (`"today"`, `"yesterday"`, `"month_to_date"`, etc.) that you want to retrieve. You can also include `filters` for dimensions and define granularity (year, month, day) and specify the `format` in which the data should be returned. The `format` options are:

- `"csv"` - Comma-separated file
- `"xls"` - Tab-separated M.S. Excel file
- `"xlsx"` - Native M.S. Excel format

> [!NOTE]
> To filter a dimension by more than one value, use an array. For example:
>
> Correct:
>
> ```
> "filters": [{"bid_type": ["learn","optimized"]}, {"geo_country":"US"}]
> ```
>
> Incorrect:
>
> ```
> "filters": [{"bid_type":"learn"}, {"bid_type":"optimized"}, {"geo_country":"US"}]
> ```
>

See [JSON Fields](#json-fields) above for more details about the fields that can be included in the request. For a full list of available dimensions and metrics, see the documentation for the specific report type that you want to run, or pull that report's metadata as described in [REST API for Viewing Metadata](#rest-api-for-viewing-metadata).

```
$ cat report_request
{
    "report": {
        "report_type": "platform_buyer",
        "report_interval": "last_48_hours",
        "columns": ["day","imps_bought"],
        "filters": [{"geo_country":"US"}],
        "orders": [{"order_by":"day", "direction":"ASC"}],
        "format": "csv"
    }
}
```

### Step 2. `POST` the request to the report service

You `POST` the JSON request and get back a report ID.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @report_request 'https://api.adnxs.com/report?member_id=255'
{
    "response": {
        "status": "OK",
        "report_id": "ca9955709eade9a0e89f5cda5345c12r",
        "dbg_info": {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 3. `GET` the report status from the report service

Make a `GET` call with the report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this call until the `"execution_status"` is `"ready"`. Then use the `report-download` service to save the reporting data to a file. (This is described in the next step.)

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.adnxs.com/report/ca9955709eade9a0e89f5cda5345c12r'
{
    "response": {
        "status": "OK",
        "report": {
            "name": null,
            "created_on": "2012-03-13 18:15:48",
            "cache_hit": false,
            "fact_cache_hit": false,
            "json_request": "{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"network_analytics\",\"report_interval\":
                \"last_48_hours\",\"columns\":[\"day\",\"imps\",\"clicks\"],\"filters\":[{\"geo_country\":
                \"US\"},{\"entity_member_id\":\"514\"},{\"entity_member_id\":null}],\"orders\":
                [{\"order_by\":\"day\",\"direction\":\"ASC\"},{\"order_by\":\"imps\",\"direction\":
                \"DESC\"}]}}",
            "header_info": "Report type:,network_analytics\r\n,\r\nRun at:,2012-03-13 18:15:48\r\nStart date:,
                \r\nEnd date:,\r\nTimezone:,\r\nUser:,John Smith (9385)\r\n",
            "report_size": "10",
            "row_count": "35",
            "url": "report-download?id=ca9955709eade9a0e89f5cda5345c12r"
        },
        "execution_status": "ready",
        "dbg_info": {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 4. `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the report ID, but this time to the `report-download` service. You can find the service and report ID in the url field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!TIP]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTPS error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your request to expose the response header.
>
> ```
> $ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=<download_id>
> ```
>

You can then open the file.
