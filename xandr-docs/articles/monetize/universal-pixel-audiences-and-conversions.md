# Universal Pixel Audiences and Conversions



After you have set up standard or custom event tracking, you can use the
data you collect to identify audiences and conversions.

An **audience**, or audience segment, consists of a collection of users
who have interacted on a website in a similar way. After you have one or
more audiences configured, you can target the audience from a line item.
A **conversion** is a specific type of interaction that indicates the
successful downstream effects of an ad campaign.

The universal pixel lets you set up highly specific audiences and
conversions based on complex rules. Rules combine one or more
**conditions** to determine what user interactions you will use to
create the event or conversion. These conditions can be based on the
URLs, standard events, and parameters your pixel is tracking. For
example, you might determine that a user who has clicked through to an
offer, viewed three or more TVs, and accessed product details for a TV
that cost over $1000 should be added to an audience segment called
High-End TV Buyers.

You combine conditions using the Boolean AND and OR operators to
identify highly specific audiences or conversion criteria. The data you
have already collected using events and parameters will guide the way
you create rules.

Note:

A rule can either have all conditions joined by AND operators or all
conditions joined by OR operators. You canâ€™t combine AND and OR in the
same ruleset.
