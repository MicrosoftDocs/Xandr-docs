# Impression Bus API



Members on the Xandr platform who build their
own bidder, either with the bidder framework or from scratch, can
configure their integration with the platform via these API Services.
For example:

- The <a
  href="bidder-service.md"
  class="xref" target="_blank">Bidder Service</a> is used to register a
  bidder with the impression bus along with its IP address and port and
  other basic information
- The <a
  href="creative-service.md"
  class="xref" target="_blank">Creative Service</a> is used to submit
  creatives for quality approval
