# Microsoft Curate - Update insertion orders

There are several actions you can take on existing insertion orders to
update them.

## Edit an insertion order

You can edit an insertion order directly from the
**Insertion Orders** screen. You can
also edit insertion orders from the
**Insertion Order Details** screen.
Click either the **Edit** icon at the top
of the screen or the **Edit** link in the
**Details** section. (See [View Insertion Order Details](view-insertion-order-details.md) for more information on the
**Details** screen.)

## Activate/Deactivate an insertion order

Check the box next to each insertion order that you want to activate or
deactivate and click **Activate** or
**Deactivate**.

## Delete an insertion order

You can delete insertion orders from the system. This is particularly
useful when you want to get rid of unnecessary or accidentally created
insertion orders.

> [!WARNING]
> Before you delete an insertion order, make sure that its child line items are associated to other insertion orders. Otherwise, you will orphan the line items and cause the line items to stop serving.

On the **Insertion Orders** screen,
check the box next to each insertion order that you want to delete and
then click **Delete**.

A confirmation dialog lists the insertion orders that you selected for
deletion. Review the list carefully and then click
**OK** to permanently delete the insertion
orders from the system.
