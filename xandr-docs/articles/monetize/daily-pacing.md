# Daily Pacing



When you set a daily budget for a campaign, you have the option to
enable **Daily Pacing**. When it is enabled, Daily Pacing helps
campaigns spend their budgets fairly evenly over the day. Without
pacing, campaigns purchase as much inventory as possible between budget
updates. If you have a campaign with a small budget or a high win rate
and pacing is not enabled, you can easily overspend your budget. While
you can take certain steps to ensure that you get the maximum benefit
from Daily Pacing, the calculations are done by the system automatically
during the day without human interaction.



<b>Note:</b> **In-flight adjustments to
budgets:** Although most user-initiated in-flight changes to budget
settings will change how the bidder responds within 5 minutes, due to
the complexity of the backend systems involved, in isolated cases, it
can take up to 4 hours for the bidder to modify its behavior in reaction
to manual in-flight budget setting changes.



Daily Pacing allows us to calculate a pacing lever which modifies the
rate at which bids are submitted, slowing the buy rate over time and
delivering the budget more evenly over the day. The pacing lever adjusts
automatically throughout the day based on the performance of the
campaign to that point in an attempt to maintain an even budget
delivery.

Xandr recommends that you enable pacing for most
campaigns.

How the System Reduces Over- or Underspend

When a campaign serves too many or too few impressions in a day, it is
called **overspend** or **underspend** (respectively). In order to avoid
either of these conditions, the system uses the following information to
determine the pacing lever:

- **The total number of minutes in the day during which your ad can
  serve** If you have not placed any restrictions regarding the time of
  day during which your ad can serve (daypart restrictions), this value
  is **1,440** (the number of minutes in a standard day). If you have
  determined that your ad can serve only from 6 - 11 a.m. and from 3 - 8
  p.m. every day (called daypart restrictions), then this value is
  **600** (10 hours per day).
- **The number of minutes remaining in the day during which your ad can
  serve** At any given point during the day, there are only so many
  minutes remaining during which your ad can serve. For example, if you
  have no daypart restrictions in place, at 10 a.m. there are **1,080**
  minutes remaining for that ad to serve. If you have daypart
  restrictions in place indicating that your ad can serve only from 6 -
  11 a.m. and from 3 - 8 p.m. every day, at 10 a.m. there are **360**
  minutes remaining for that ad to serve (one available hour until 11
  a.m., and then five available hours from 3 - 8 p.m.).
- **The budget spent up to the most recent time stamp** The system must
  know how much of the budget has been spent at a given point in time in
  order to determine if it is necessary to change the daily pacing
  lever.
- **The budget spent during the last budget update** In order to
  determine a trend, the system must know how much of the budget has
  been spent in the period between the two most recent time stamps.
- **The daily budget** This is the amount of the budget that should
  serve on the current day.



<b>Note:</b> When referring to the budget
spent, you can use quantity (i.e., 156 ads served) or dollar amounts
(i.e., $1,850 of ads served). However, you must use the same value for
all calculations. Budgets set in dollar amounts are set against booked
revenue at the line item level, and against media cost at the campaign
level.



The system periodically checks this information (approximately every 15
minutes) and determines if the pacing lever needs to be adjusted.

Example

- You have a campaign with a daily budget of **2,000** impressions
  (i.e., must be met by 12 a.m. midnight).
- As of 8 p.m. (the most recent time stamp), the system had served
  **1,200** impressions for the day.
- As of 7:45 p.m., the system had served **1,175** impressions for the
  day.
- There are no daypart restrictions.

In order to reach your budget of **2,000** impressions, we must serve
**800** more impressions in four hours. Since we served an average of
**25** impressions in the previous 15-minute period, we will likely only
serve another **400** impressions before the end of the day. This will
represent a budget underspend. Therefore, in order to meet the daily
budget amount, the system increases the bid rate enough so that it will
win an additional **400** impressions by midnight.

How the System Moderates the Pacing Settings

When the system modifies the daily pacing to account for daily over- or
underspend, it can be in danger of generating a spend spike. For
example, the process described in the example above is unable to
consider that this ad wins a great number of bids between 11:30 p.m. and
midnight; if the daily pacing lever is adjusted without considering
this, the system is likely to drastically overspend in the last 30
minutes of the day (generating a "spike" in successful bids) and
exceeding the budget amount significantly. It is also possible to
perform this in reverse (reduce a bid so drastically that it falls well
below the budget amount).

To combat this, the system uses the three most-recently completed pacing
values (which includes the over- or undespend pacing value) to determine
the pacing value for the coming period. This more-closely aligns the
bidder to the correct bid rate, and also moderates the pacing value.

How you can Ensure Proper Pacing for your Campaign

Due to the complexity of bidding in real time, it is extremely difficult
to provide exact pacing. Our system must rely on certain assumptions
about earlier performance in order to maintain a steady and even rate of
delivery for the remainder of the day. Campaigns that do not conform to
these assumptions will have a greater difficulty pacing evenly compared
to campaigns that do. Therefore, the more you comply with the following
guidelines, the greater the likelihood that your campaign will enjoy
smooth delivery.

- **Limit intra-day changes to inventory, bids, or targeting** Since we
  can't predict how much inventory a campaign will win in real time, we
  rely on recent delivery as an indicator of future delivery. If you
  increase these values, you will change the rate of won impressions;
  however, we could continue pacing based on the delivery rate before
  the change for up to two budget cycles (20-40 minutes). If the
  difference between delivery rates is great enough, the budget will
  overspend or deliver faster than anticipated, before pacing can
  account for the new win rate. Therefore, try to perform as few of
  these in-flight changes as possible.
- **Keep your budgets consistent** Budgets set at the campaign level
  have no knowledge of budgets set at the line item level, and
  vice-versa, so if one campaign has used all of its allotted budget,
  the other will not adjust the rate at which it is pacing to
  compensate. Therefore, you should make sure that campaign level
  budgets and line item daily budgets do not restrict each other.
- **The smaller your budget, the greater the margin for error** In order
  to spend a budget, a portion of it must be allocated to each bidder.
  Considering the number of individual bidders within
  Xandr (thousands), it becomes more difficult
  to allocate that amount accurately. This leads to us delivering
  budgets much faster than expected. To combat this situation, you can
  do one of the following:
  - **Increase the budget:** This gives pacing a chance to work.
  - **Decrease the win rate:** The most effective way to do this is to
    reduce your bid amount.
  - **Decrease the pool of available inventory:** You can do this by
    adding targeting, limiting delivery to certain high-quality buyers,
    or both.
- **Ensure that your Learn Budget amount does not restrict your Daily
  Pacing amount** When using optimization, if you set a learn budget
  amount that is less than the daily pacing amount, new campaigns (with
  no optimized inventory) will stop serving when the learn budget amount
  is reached. For more information, see
