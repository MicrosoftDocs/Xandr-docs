# Invalid Postal and ZIP Codes



Certain real ZIP or postal codes can be invalid within the
Xandr geography targeting system. This happens
when <a href="https://www.digitalelement.com/" class="xref"
target="_blank">Digital Envoy</a>, a Xandr
partner that handles geolocation data, can't recognize a ZIP or postal
code's existence because no IP address (internet user) has been
associated with it.

Postal codes that don't exist in the system often represent obscure or
otherwise small geographical zones with minimal internet activity.
Additionally, certain ZIP or postal codes that are in close proximity to
or overlap with other ZIP or postal codes may be considered invalid.
Digital Envoy constantly updates its postal code database, so a ZIP or
postal code's invalid status within the Xandr
geography targeting system is always subject to change.
