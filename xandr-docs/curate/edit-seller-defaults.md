# Microsoft Curate - Edit seller defaults

You can set the eligibility and inventory trust for sellers in the **Partner Center** screen or in the **My Settings for {Seller Name}** section of the **Partner Details** page.

> [!NOTE]
> Inventory trust settings only apply to standard line item targeting.

Sellers can see the settings you have set for them. Your default settings will apply if you do not set custom settings for the seller. For more information on default settings, see [Set Seller Defaults](set-seller-defaults.md).

While you can change your settings for the seller, you cannot change the seller's settings for you. You can change your settings for the seller in the **Partner Center** screen and in the **My Settings for {Seller Name}** section of the **Partner Details** page. You can view the seller's current settings for you in the **{Seller Name} Settings for Me** section of the **Partner Details** page.

## Get to Know Microsoft Advertising Direct

Microsoft Advertising Direct is a group of 100+ sellers we have identified as mostly selling owned and operated inventory or selling through exclusive relationships with publishers. For more information, please see [Microsoft Advertising Direct for Buyers](appnexus-direct-for-buyers.md) or contact [appnexusdirect@appnexus.com](mailto:appnexusdirect@appnexus.com) or your Microsoft Advertising account manager.

## Edit seller settings

### Step 1. Get started

Go to the **Partner Center** screen (**Admin** \> **Partner Center**) and click on a seller's name:

- To edit a single seller's settings, click **Edit** in the **My Settings for {Seller Name}** section to display seller settings.
- To edit multiple sellers, select the checkbox of the sellers you want to edit and click **Edit Selected Sellers** to display the **Edit Partner Controls** section. Any changes you make will be applied to all checked sellers.

### Step 2. Update settings

#### Apply your default settings

To apply seller defaults (see [Set Seller Defaults](set-seller-defaults.md)):

- For a single seller in the **My Settings for {Seller Name}** section, select **Default** from the dropdown.

- For multiple sellers in the **Edit Partner Controls** section, select **Default**.

  When **Default** is selected, the current default settings display for reference.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > If you select **Default**, the **Inventory Trust Settings** will follow the default settings.

#### Set custom settings

1. Set custom settings:
    - For a single seller in the **My Settings for {Seller Name}** section, select **Custom** from the dropdown.
    - For multiple sellers, the settings are available in the **Edit Partner Controls** section.
1. Select the custom settings:
    - **Seller Eligibility** - the transaction eligibility between buyer and seller. A buyer may block a seller, a seller may block a buyer, or both buyer and seller may be blocked by each other, see [Partner Center Screen](partner-center-screen-buyer-view.md).
    - **Inventory Trust Level** - indicates whether you trust inventory reviewed only by the Microsoft Advertising platform (**Platform-reviewed**), by the Microsoft Advertising platform and the seller (**Seller-reviewed**), or all inventory (**All**). For more information on the different inventory trust levels, see the **Setting default inventory trust** section in [Partner Center Screen](partner-center-screen-buyer-view.md).

## Step 3. Save your changes

When all changes have been made, click **Apply**.
