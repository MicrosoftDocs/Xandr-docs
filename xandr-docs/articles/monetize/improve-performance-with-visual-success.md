# Improve performance with Visual Success

Visual Success is a tool available on the **Insertion Order Details** and **Line Item Details** pages, designed to help campaign managers achieve better overall performance. It provides easy access to change history, performance, delivery, and other metrics for line items and campaigns. You can use these metrics to see how the campaigns under your line item or insertion order are performing as a group, and assess for possible trouble spots at the campaign, line item, and insertion order levels.

You can also expand each of the plus signs in the **Change History** panel to show details of what was changed.

## Understanding Visual Success data

**Visual Success** data consists of four main categories:

- Flight
- Delivery
- Performance
- Margin

### Flight

The **Flight** section has two horizontal bars. The first blue bar details the changes in your line item, or campaigns, on a given date. The second bar tells you how many days into your insertion order's or line item's flight you are. It shows the flight start and end dates and how much of your flight is completed.

If there are no flight dates, **Visual Success** will show the range of dates for which there was delivery on that insertion order or line item.

### Delivery

The **Delivery** section shows whether your insertion order or line item is delivering on pace. It tells you how close you are to delivering on pace as a percentage of your delivery goal.

### Performance

The **Performance** section shows how well your insertion order or line item has performed to date. The solid performance line shows daily performance while the dashed line shows cumulative performance.

You can select among average CTR, average CPC, or average CPA by clicking the metric of your choice.

### Margin

The **Margin** section shows your average margin and daily margin to date. The percentage is the running average, and the graph shows the daily margin.

## Troubleshoot with Visual Success

Using Visual Success, you can identify trouble spots with a quick visual scan.

### Signs of under-delivery

If your delivery is below 100%, you may want to make changes to pacing settings to spend faster.

Similarly, if you are spending far above or below the needed daily budget for the remaining days, you may want to adjust your daily budget for the line item to keep spending on track.

### Big peaks or valleys in performance metrics

Sudden, sharp changes in average CTR, CPC, or CPA may indicate a problem. Check targeting, frequency capping, and other settings that limit the circumstances in which the line item can spend.
