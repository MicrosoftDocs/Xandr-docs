# Selling Deals



As a seller, you can use deals to provide buyers special access to your
inventory and/or data. For example, a deal might provide preferential
pricing on inventory, access to exclusive inventory, reduced competition
on inventory, or other opportunities.

There are two ways to offer deals to buyers:

- **Packages** - Packages are pre-assembled combinations of your
  inventory and/or data. Buyers can browse packages and create deals
  from them "off-the-shelf," or they can use packages as a jumping-off
  point for deal negotiations.
- **Deals** - In cases where your packages don't meet a buyer's needs,
  you can create custom deals for buyers.
