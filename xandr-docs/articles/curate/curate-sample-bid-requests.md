# Sample Bid Requests



<div id="curate-monitoring__p-2392ddd0-f0f4-4284-b441-40038f1f8c34"

The Bid Request Sampler provides
sample bid request data under certain time frames and conditions. You
can download results as a text file.



Note: The sampler only returns bid
requests for curated deals issued to external DSPs, not the Invest DSP.





To sample bid request data:

1.  In Date, select the date and
    time in which you want to pull bid requests.
    

    Note: id requests are pulled within
    the previous 24 hours of the date and time you select. You can only
    select a date and time within the last 7 days.

    
2.  In Media Type, select either
    Any Media Type or a specific media
    type (Banner,
    Video,
    Native, or
    Audio).
3.  In Country, select either
    Any Country or
    Custom Country (use the
    Select Country drop-down to select
    a country from the list).
4.  In Number of Bid Request,
    select the number of bid requests you would like to pull.
    

    Note: Bid requests are limited to a
    maximum of 100.

    
5.  Click Search to generate bid
    requests.

Note: Bid requests are generated using a 0.001% sampling rate. If you
try to generate a bid request and don't see results, Xandr will
automatically increase the sampling rate to 5%. Wait 30 minutes for this
sampling rate change to take effect before you generate another bid
request. You don't have to keep the **Bid Request Sampler** section open
while you wait 30 minutes before generating a new request. You can leave
the section and come back to generate a new request after 30 minutes
have passed.

Bid requests (if any) are listed in the
Bid Request section. You can do
the following with the results:

  Export All as Text File. The text
  file is downloaded to your browserâ€™s downloads folder.
- Copy the generated bid requests by clicking
  Copy Request to Clipboard.
- Open the generated bid requests in a new browser tab by clicking
  Open in New Window.
