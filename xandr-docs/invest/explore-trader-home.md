# Microsoft Invest - Explore Trader Home

The right pane window displays the insertion order and its associated line items details for the advertiser selected in the left pane

### Insertion order card view

- To enhance visibility, the right panel displays all insertion order(s) associated with an advertiser. This panel is infinitely scrollable, ensuring that you never lose sight of any important data. 
- Each Insertion Order card on the dashboard is color-coded, providing a quick visual indicator for any issues with its pacing status. 
> [!NOTE]
> The orange bar at the top of the card indicates pacing status: under pacing when it is less than or equal to 89%, and over pacing when it is greater than or equal to 150%.

### Insertion order metrics

- Each card displays metrics to help you assess the status of your insertion orders. The insertion order card offers easy access to the pacing health and requirements for successful delivery of your campaigns.
- Each insertion order card serves as a snapshot of an individual insertion order, providing key performance metrics at a glance, such as pacing, yesterday's spend, and today's spend.
- You can customize the metrics in each card using the **Modify Cards** button on the top right corner, allowing customization with up to 5 different custom metrics.

- In the Trader Home, each Insertion orders card features a “Favourite” option. This enables you to quickly bookmark your most important or frequently accessed Insertion Orders by clicking the “star” icon at the bottom of the card

### Sorting and filtering

- By default, the Insertion order list is sorted by “Recently Modified” and filtered on Active state, making it easier to manage and analyze the campaigns.
- Users can further customize the view by using filters, enabling refinement of the Insertion orders list based on their statuses:
    - active 
    - favourites 
- And by sorting through 
    - **Recency:**
        - Recently Created
        - Recently Modified
    - **Pacing:**
        - Ascending 
        - Descending
