# Creative Upload service - File format

The Creative Upload service provides the ability to upload a file and get a **media asset object** in return.

> [!NOTE]
> Media assets that are not associated to a creative can be cleaned up at any time.

## Format overview

The creative upload service is a multi-part form post. There are a few parameters required to construct the post.

The following table describes the ordering of the forms that compose the post:

| [Authorization](#authorization) | [Form Type](#form-type) | [Form File Upload](#form-file-upload) | [AppNexus API](#appnexus-api) |

## Authorization

| Name | Type | Description | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `Authorization` | string | The token received when authenticated to AppNexus API. | `"hbapi:108172:05866d06f6964:nym2"` |

For more information, see [API Authentication](04---api-authentication.md).

### Form type

Use the first form to define the **type** of file you are looking to upload.

| Name | Type | Description | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `form` | string | Define the type of file you are looking to upload. | `--form "type=video"` |

### Accepted file types

| Type | Value |
|:---|:---|
| `html` | "zip". |
| `video` | "webm","mkv","flv","vob","ogv","ogg","avi","mov","qt","wmv","rm","asf","mp4","m4p","m4v","mpg","mp2","mpeg","mpe","mpv","m2v","m4v",<br>"3gp","3g2","f4v","f4p","f4a","f4b", "swf". |
| `audio` | "aac","webm","mkv","flv","vob","ogv","ogg","avi","mov","qt","wmv","rm","asf","mp3","mp4","m4p","m4v","mpg","mp2","mpeg","mpe","mpv",<br>"m2v","m4v","3gp","3g2","f4v","f4p","f4a","f4b", "swf", "wav". |
| `image` | "jpeg", "jpg", "gif", "png", "swf". |
| `default` |  |

> [!NOTE]
> .mov videos will play in all browsers after the video finishes transcoding, however, there may be a delay in previewing.

### Form file upload

Use the next form to define the **path** to the file you want to upload.

| Name | Type | Description | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `form` | string | Define the path to the file you want to upload. | `--form "file=@/Folder1/Folder2/Downloads/IMG_0332.JPG"` |

### AppNexus API

Define the **URL** to the AppNexus API and point to the `creative-upload` end point. Member ID is required.

| Name | Type | Description | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `URL` | string | Define HTTP protocol and the `creative-upload` endpoint. | `"https://api.appnexus.com/creative-upload?member_id=123"` |

## Example

The following example illustrates a scenario derived from a real use case.

A client is uploading an image file to member 123.

| Field | Value |
|:---|:---|
| `Authorization` | `hbapi:139072:5761726637ada:nym2` |
| `Form Type` | `image` |
| `Form File Upload` | `Folder1/Folder2/IMG_0332.JPG` |
| `AppNexus API` | `https://api.appnexus.com/creative-upload?member_id=12` |

### A client is uploading an image file to member 123

```
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: hbapi:139072:5761726637ada:nym2" --form "type=image" --form "file=@/Folder1/Folder2/IMG_0332.JPG" "https://api.appnexus.com/creative-upload?member_id=123"
