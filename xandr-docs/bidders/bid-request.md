# Bidders - Bid request

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - **Not Supported**: The AppNexus Bidding Protocol is no longer supported; this documentation is for legacy purposes only. We will deprecate this protocol on December 1, 2018.
> - If you're a new bidder integrating with AppNexus, please see the [OpenRTB 2.4 Bidding Protocol](https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OpenRTB-API-Specification-Version-2-4-FINAL.pdf).

A Bid Request is sent to bidders whenever an ad call reaches the Impression Bus. It contains all the necessary information for a bidder to produce a bid price and a creative to serve.

The Bid Request includes information from sellers that specifies which advertisers and creatives are allowed to win an auction and run on a page. This information is stored into an ad approval profile, which bidders can use to make sure that their bids are accepted.

## Throttling bid requests

You may not wish to receive all bid requests that pass through the AppNexus platform. You can either throttle requests by some percentage, or filter requests by preset criteria such as geography.

## Multi-tag bid requests

We sometimes send "multi-tag bid requests" where one Bid Request may include multiple tag IDs with potentially different sizes, ad quality standards, reserve prices, etc. For now, these requests should be handled with individual responses for each tag as if they were independent requests. However, in the near future, these multi-tag requests will be the foundation for takeovers, full page buyouts, and many other premium inventory features.

Each individual tag in a multi-tag request has a unique auction ID.

## Implementation

### Request headers

| Field | Scope | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Connection` | all | string | Always set to "keep-alive" to ensure persistent TCP connections. |
| `Content-Length` | all | int | Length of the body of the HTTP request (which includes all fields described below). |

| `X-Debug` | some | int | If set to 1, the ad call included the debug=1 flag, and no ad will be served. |
| `X-DMA` | some | int | Code for the designated market area of the user based on IP address, if it can be determined. |
| `X-Exclusive` | some | int | Indicates whether or not the auction is exclusive by default. An exclusive auction is one in which only the placement owner can serve an ad. The exclusive default may be overridden by the owner during the owner phase of the auction. |
| `X-Segment` | some | string | A comma-separated list of segments that the user is in. Segments available include those owned by your members and those owned by 3rd party data providers (to whom AppNexus has granted your bidder access). |

### Deals

Each object in the `deals` array contains the following fields.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ad_quality_override` | int | Specifies how the deal handles creatives: <br> - `1`: Creatives use existing ad quality settings. (Default) <br> - `2`: Creatives in "pending" audit status will serve. Once these creatives are audited, the existing ad quality settings are used. <br> - `3`: No ad profile restrictions will be applied to this deal. (Maximum trust) |
| `allowed_media_subtypes` | array of integers. | Specifies the IDs of the media subtypes that are allowed on this deal. Use the [Media Subtype Service](../digital-platform-api/media-subtype-service.md) to view a list of media subtypes. If there are no unique media subtypes for this deal as compared to the main bid request object, this field will be an empty array. This does NOT mean the deal does not allow any media subtypes, instead it just means that the media subtypes on the main bid object should be used when bidding on this deal. |
| `allowed_media_types` | array of integers. | Specifies the IDs of the media types that are allowed on this deal. Use the [Media Type Service](../digital-platform-api/media-type-service.md) to view a list of media types. If there are no unique media types for this deal as compared to the main bid request object, this field will be an empty array. This does NOT mean the deal does not allow any media types, instead it just means that the media types on the main bid object should be used when bidding on this deal. |
| `floor_cpm` | double | The price the seller has set for the deal. Use this amount plus any applicable fees as your minimum bid in order to compete for this inventory. Note that bidding this amount plus any applicable fees will help ensure that you are eligible for the deal but will not guarantee that your bid wins. <br> This amount will always be in US dollars. Ask prices entered in another currency will be converted to dollars. |
| `id` |  int | The ID of the deal that applies to the impression. You can use the [Deal Buyer Access Service](deal-buyer-access-service.md) to view the deal's details including deal name, description, start and end date, and associated inventory. |
| `member_id` | int | The ID of the buyer member for whom the deal was created. |
| `sizes` | array of strings. | Allowable creative sizes for this deal, given in "widthxheight" format. If there are no unique sizes for this deal as compared to the main bid request object, this field will be an empty array. This does NOT mean the deal does not allow any sizes, instead it just means that the sizes on the main bid object should be used when bidding on this deal. |

### Bid_Info

Information on the user and the overall bid request.

#### User

| Field | Scope | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `user_id_64` | all | int | The unique 64-bit ID for the user. It will be the same for all requests from this user until cookies are cleared. <br><br> **Note**: This value is only populated when the field `no_cookies` is `false`. <br><br> This field is `0` when AppNexus does not have a match for this user or the user's browser doesn't accept cookies. It will be `-1` for opt-out users. |
| `user_agent` | some | string | The "User-Agent" header from the browser. (In other words the type of browser.) |
| `operating_system` | some | int | The ID of the user's operating system. You can use the [Operating System Service](operating-system-service.md) to map operating system IDs to names. |

| `language` | some | int | The ID of the language as parsed from the accepted_languages string. You can use the [Language Service](language-service.md) to map languages to names. |
| `no_flash` | all | boolean | Informs the bidder if we have detected that the user's browser does not have flash installed. |
| `no_cookies` | all | boolean | If the `no_cookies` field is set to `false`<br> - AppNexus is able to track the user via a user id that is placed in a cookie in the user's browser. <br> - The user id will be contained in the `user_id_64` field on the bid request. <br><br> If the `no_cookies` field is set to `true` AND the `user_id_64` field is set to `0` <br> - AppNexus is not able to track the user since the user's browser does not accept cookies. <br> - You should not bid for such an auction on behalf of campaigns that require user data (e.g. frequency capping, recency capping). <br><br> If the `no_cookies` field is set to `true` AND the `user_id_64` field is **nonzero** <br> - AppNexus is able to track the user via cookies, and the user_id_64 field contains the user id. <br> - However, a problem occurred while looking up user information in the AppNexus server-side user data store. <br> - As a result, the bid request will not include user data, nor can AppNexus reliably update user data based on commands sent in the bid response. <br> - You should not bid for such an auction on behalf of campaigns that require user data (e.g. frequency capping, recency capping). |
| `gender` | some  | enum | "male" or "female" - This data may be supplied by the publisher at auction time. |

Contact your AppNexus technical representative for more information. |
| `domain` | some | string | The domain of the referral URL. |
| `inventory_audits` | some | array | AppNexus audit data about the content of the site. Audits on bid_info pertain to all tags in the auction. This info often comes from a domain-level audit. Described in more detail below. |
| `within_iframe` | all | boolean | If the tag sits on the page with no enclosing iframes, this is `'true'`. Note that if AppNexus is unable to determine whether the tag is wrapped, this will be `'false'`. |
| `publisher_id` | some | int | The ID of the publisher. Publishers are used as the largest groupings of inventory for members that sell their inventory through AppNexus. Bidders cannot lookup what publisher the ID corresponds to, but these IDs can be used as anonymous, optimizeable chunks of inventory. |
| `is_secure` | some | boolean | If the page is secure, this is true. <br><br> **Note**: All connections to secure inventory must be secure. This includes pixels, creatives and 3rd party calls. (i.e. for a creative: `https://mysecure.content.com/ad/ABC.123.com/DEF.40;sz=300x250) \\`) |
