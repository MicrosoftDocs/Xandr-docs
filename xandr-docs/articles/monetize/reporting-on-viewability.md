# Microsoft Monetize - Reporting on viewability

This page defines viewability metrics that are available and best
practices for making optimal use of them.

Microsoft Advertising provides **always-on**, **free**,
**reliable** and **independent** ad-viewability measurement to all
participants of the internet advertising industry. Viewability improves
the performance and quality of internet advertising.

## Viewability definitions

### Viewability measurement metrics

Not all impressions are successfully measured, because of one, or more
of the following:

- Unsupported environment - the script does not attempt to measure
  viewability in this environment because it isn't supported.
- Partial implementation - the script could not be successfully loaded
  in the browser. For example, the user left the page before the ad call
  response was returned.
- Technical limitation - the script successfully loaded in the browser,
  but still couldn't be measured.

> [!NOTE]
> Viewability metrics in reporting will be available at the same time that impression level metrics become available.

| Viewability Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| View-Measured Imps | The total number of impressions that were measured for viewability. |
| Viewability Measurement Rate | The percentage of impressions measured for viewability out of the total number of impressions. (View Measured Imps / Imps) |

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Advertising measured viewability rate should not be directly compared to other measurement vendors, due to differences in what, where and how impressions were served.

### Viewability metrics

| Viewability Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| View-Measured Imps | The total number of impressions that were measured for viewability. |
| Viewability Measurement Rate | The percentage of impressions measured for viewability out of the total number of impressions. (View Measured Imps / Imps) |

> [!NOTE]
> An impression that could not be measured will not have a viewability status.

## Viewability reporting

### Reports with viewability metrics

Viewability metrics are included in several reports in the reporting
system:

| Network | Advertisers | Publishers |
|---|---|---|
| - [Network Analytics Report](network-analytics-report.md)<br> - [Seller Site Domain Report](seller-site-domain-report.md) | - [Advertiser Analytics Report](advertiser-analytics-report.md)<br> - [Site Domain Performance](site-domain-performance.md) | - [Publisher Analytics](publisher-analytics.md)<br> - [Seller Site Domain Report](seller-site-domain-report.md) |

### How to add viewability metrics

Go to the appropriate tab and select
**Reporting** from the navigation menu.
Select the type of report from the drop-down menu.

Viewability indicators are located in the
**Metrics** section. Click the
**Edit** button to select the desired
indicators.

> [!NOTE]
> For an explanation of how metrics work, see [Dimensions, Metrics, Filtering, and Grouping](dimensions-metrics-filtering-and-grouping.md).

### Impression-Level viewability

A column in the Log Level Data Standard Feed enables impression-level
viewability analytics. You can determine the result of the
Microsoft Advertising viewability measurement for each
individual impression and use the data to perform enhanced reporting and
in-depth analysis.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| VIEW_RESULT_TYPE | The possible values are:<br> - Measured Viewable<br> - Measured Non-Viewable<br> - Non-Measured |

For more information, see [Log-Level Data Feeds](../log-level-data/log-level-data-feeds.md) and [Standard Feed](../log-level-data/standard-feed.md).

## Best practices

### Viewable imps and viewability rate

If you select **Viewable Imps** and
**Viewability Rate**, it is recommended
that you add **View-Measured Imps** as
well.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viewability Rate = Viewable Imps / View-Measured Imps

**Viewability Rate** is NOT **Viewable Imps / All Imps.**

For example:

- **All Imps** = 1,000,000
- **Viewed** **Imps** = 450,000

**Viewability Rate** = 50%

Without **View-Measured Imps**, you would think the results are
incorrect, and believe that **Viewability Rate** should be 450,000 /
1,000,000 = 45%, not 50%.

When you add **View-Measured Imps**, you will see that the total number
of successfully measured imps = 900,000.

**Viewability Rate = Viewable Imps / View-Measured Imps** = 450,000 /
900,000 = **50%**
