#  Microsoft Monetize - Duplicate an existing custom creative template

Instead of creating a creative template from scratch, you can duplicate existing standard or custom creative templates and then modify the rendering code and macros as necessary.

1. Navigate to the **Creative Templates** screen by clicking **Network** \> **Tools** \> **Creative Templates**.
1. Select the checkboxes for the corresponding creative templates that need to be duplicated.
1. Click the **Actions** pull-down menu and select **Duplicate**.
1. Enter a new name in the **Duplicate Name** field for each creative template that is being duplicated and click **Duplicate**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Name** helps buyers identify the creative template when uploading creatives that match this template's media type and format, so use a name that buyers will easily recognize.

    The **Creative Templates** screen displays.

1. Search for the duplicated creative templates by name.

    A list of search results displays.

1. Select the newly duplicated creative template from the **Creative Templates** grid.

    The **Creative Template Details** pane displays.

1. Click **Edit**.

    The **Edit Template** screen displays. The **Media Type**, **Creative Format**, **Template Code**, and macros will be auto-populated with the values from the template that was duplicated.

1. Update any of the following fields:
    1. **Name**: The name of the creative template, which helps buyers identify the creative template when uploading creatives that match this template's media type and format.

        > [!TIP]
        > Be sure to use a name that buyers will easily recognize.

    1. **Media Type**: Defines the display style of the creatives that can use the template, such as banner.
    1. **Creative Format**: Defines the creative resource type that can use this template such as Flash, iframe, or External File.
    1. **Template Code**: Specifies how the creative should be rendered.

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you include custom macros in the template code, they must begin with the `#` symbol. If you include standard macros in the template code, they must begin with the `$` symbol. Be sure to replace any hard-coded `adnxs.com` references within the **Template Code** field with the `${XANDR_DOMAIN}` macro to ensure that the appropriate domain `adnxs.com` or `adnxs-simple.com` will be used when the auction takes place.

1. Expand the **Custom macros** section if necessary.
1. If no custom macros exist in the **Custom macros** section, or if you want to add more custom macros, click **Add Macros** and do the following:

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can add up to 20 custom macros. If the template is being used by any active creatives, you cannot add additional custom macros.

    1. Enter a name for this macro in the **Name** field that buyers will see when they upload creatives that use this template.

        The **Name** field is limited to a maximum of 50 characters.

    1. Select a macro type from the **Type** pull-down menu such as **String** and **True** / **False**.

        For example, if you select **True** / **False**, buyers will see the macro name followed by a checkbox.

    1. If you selected **Select from List**, enter a value for **Option 1**.

        To add more options, click **Add another option** and enter the corresponding value.

    1. If you want to require buyers to complete the macro when uploading new creatives that use this template, click the **Required** checkbox.
    1. If you do not want the macro to be required, enter the **Default Value** that will be used when buyers do not complete the macro during creative uploads.
1. Repeat step 10 to add each individual custom macro.
1. Update the details for any of the existing custom macros if necessary.
1. Repeat steps 5 - 12 for each duplicated creative template.
1. Click **Save**.

    The new creative template is active by default and can be applied to new creatives.
