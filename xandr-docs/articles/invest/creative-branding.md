# Microsoft Invest - creative branding 

Microsoft Advertising maintains and monitors a brand list,
ensuring duplicate brands and URLs are deleted or reassigned in order to
maintain consistency.

A brand is a proprietary classification assigned to creatives. Within
the Microsoft Advertising system, each brand has an ID and is
assigned an associated URL and relevant brand content categories that
describe the offerings and services provided by the company. Accurate
branding is essential to maintaining the integrity of the
Microsoft Advertising platform. The consistency and quality of
our offering is incredibly important to us, and we invest significant
resources to its maintenance.

During the creative audit process, a brand name/URL are associated with
every creative. If the appropriate brand exists within the
Microsoft Advertising system, the creative will be assigned a
URL associated with the existing brand. If the appropriate brand does
not exist within the Microsoft Advertising system, the creative
will be assigned to a comparable existing brand based on the creative
content and the creative's associated landing page.

## Existing brand content categories

When a brand is created, it is given a name, an associated URL, and a
brand content category. This brand content category attempts to best
describe the offering of the parent company. Brand content categories
can be used to include or exclude creatives from serving.
