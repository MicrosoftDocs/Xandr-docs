# Getting Paid by Xandr





In order to receive prompt payment from Xandr,
you must submit your banking details to your
Xandr representative upon signing your contract.
To update your banking details, contact Client Finance at
<a href="mailto:billing@xandr.com" class="xref"
target="_blank">billing@xandr.com</a>.

Xandr pays you within a fixed period of time
(e.g.. Net 60, Net 90) from the last day of the month in which the
reselling activity occurs (so long as the total is at least $50 for that
month). If reselling activity for a given month is under $50, we'll hold
payment until you are able to compound at least $50. Once you have
compounded in excess of $50 in resold revenue, we'll transfer the full
amount to the bank account that we have on file.

In additional, you should expect payment from
Xandr within two to three business days from the
date that the payment is due (e.g., Net 60, Net 90).
Xandr makes payment disbursement on the last day
of each month, and it generally takes the banks those business days to
clear the payment (not including weekends and holidays).

Xandr reserves the right to withhold payment if
you have outstanding unpaid invoices for buying activity under your
member account.

For your exact payment terms refer to your Xandr
contract.
