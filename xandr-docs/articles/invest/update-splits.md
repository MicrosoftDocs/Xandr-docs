# Microsoft Invest - Update splits

The below topics cover all that you can do to update splits.

## Edit a split

You can edit splits from the **Edit Line Item** screen. Expand the **Programmable Splits** section. Select a split from the Splits table or click on the pencil icon next to the split name.

## Duplicate a split

1. Select the split(s) you'd like to duplicate and click **Actions \>  Duplicate Selected**.
1. By default, the new splits have the same names as the original splits but with "COPY" as a prefix. If necessary, update the names
for the new splits.

Once you duplicate a split, you will need to manually readjust
allocations and priorities.

## Activate/Deactivate a split

Select the split(s) you'd like to activate or deactivate and click **Actions  \>  Activate Selected** or **Actions \> Deactivate Selected**.

When you activate a split:

- It will automatically receive the lowest priority, which you can
  adjust at will.
- It is allocated 0% of the line item budget. You will need to adjust
  allocations manually.

When you deactivate a split:

- Priorities will readjust automatically.
- The split allocation is reassigned to the line item remainder.

## Remove all splits

Select the split(s) you'd like to activate or deactivate and click **Actions \>  Remove All Splits**.
