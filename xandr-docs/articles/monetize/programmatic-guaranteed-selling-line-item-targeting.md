# Programmatic Guaranteed Selling Line Item Targeting



You can use the Programmatic Guaranteed line item targeting settings to
decide how your deal's buyer targets and serves creatives on your
inventory by including geography, device type, system, daypart,
key/value, page property, and demographic information.



Line item targeting is an essential narrowing process that directs ad
campaigns to valuable inventory and avoids spending money on ads that
aren't likely to provide significant ROI. Each targeting option has its
own set of considerations and configuration instructions.
