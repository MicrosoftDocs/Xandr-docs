# Microsoft Monetize - Reporting (Cross-Device)

Reporting on cross-device targeting and measurement is available in the
NetworkAnalytics report, the Device Analytics
report, and the Data Usage report, as well as on the
**Analytics** tab for the augmented
line item.

> Cross Device Metrics on the Line Item Analytics tab includes data for the last 60 days only.

## Reports with Cross-Device metrics
