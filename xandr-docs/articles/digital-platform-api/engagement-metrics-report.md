| `viewed_imps` | int | `1872` | viewed_impsview_non_measurable_reason | The number of measured impressions that were viewable according to the IAB Viewability definition, which states that an impression is viewable if 50% of the pixels are in view for 1 continuous second. |
| `viewability_measurement_rate` | double | `45`% | View Measured Imps / Imps | The percentage of impressions measured for viewability out of the total number of impressions. (View Measured Imps / Imps). |

| `not_viewed_imps` (`insufficient_duration`) | int | `50` | not applicable | The number of impressions not viewed because time threshold based on IAB definition was not met. |
| `not_viewed_imps` (`unknown`) | int | `75` | not applicable | The number of impressions not viewed because of an unknown reason. |

## Example

### Create the JSON-formatted report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` of `"engagement_metrics_network"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the format in which the data should be returned (`"csv"`, `"excel"`, or `"html"`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md).

```
$ cat engagement_metrics_network
  {
    "report":
    {
        "report_type":"engagement_metrics_network",
        "columns":[
            "advertiser",
            "insertion_order",
            "creative",
            "device_type",
            "imps",
            "in_view_duration",
            "viewability_rate"
        ],
        "report_interval":"last_7_days",
        "format":"csv"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the reporting service

```
$ curl -b cookies -X POST -d @engagement_metrics_network 'https://api.appnexus.com/report'
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"097f59fc3ab7d02c5d60db42081d9b69"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service

Make a `GET` call with the Report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=097f59fc3ab7d02c5d60db42081d9b69'
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report":{
         "name":null,
         "created_on":"2010-05-25 19:19:53",
         "json_request":"{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"engagement_metrics_network\",\"columns\":[\"advertiser\",
            \"insertion_order\",\"creative\",\"device_type\",\"imps\",\"in_view_duration\",\"viewability_rate\"],
            \"report_interval\":\"last_7_days\"}}",
         "url": "report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592"
      },
      "execution_status":"ready"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the Report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and Report ID in the `url` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!NOTE]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592' > /tmp/engagement_metrics_network.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
