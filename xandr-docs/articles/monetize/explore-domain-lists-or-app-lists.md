# Explore Domain Lists or App Lists







Note: Targeting lists are only
available to Standard Line Items. For an overview of which targeting
options are available to Standard versus Augmented Line items, see
<a href="buy-side-targeting.html" class="xref">Buy-Side Targeting</a>.



You can add domains and apps to lists, export domain lists or app lists
to a text file for safekeeping or offline use, create new domain lists
or app lists by copying existing lists, or delete domain lists and app
lists. For information about creating these lists, see
<a href="create-a-domain-list-or-app-list.html" class="xref">Create a
Domain List or App List</a>. For information about updating these lists,
see
<a href="update-a-domain-list-or-app-list.html" class="xref">Update a
Domain List or App List</a>.

Overview

To perform any **Actions** on a domain list or app list:

1.  Select
    Network
     \>  Inventory  \>
     Targeting Lists from the
    top navigation menu.
2.  Select Domain Lists or
    App Lists tab.
3.  Check the checkbox next to the domain lists or app lists that you
    would like to perform an action on.
4.  Click the **Actions** drop-down and choose the appropriate action
    (see below for details for each action).



Note: Domain targeting applies only to
**Web** and **Mobile Web** impressions and does not apply to **Mobile
App** impressions. If you have allowed your campaign to serve on mobile
apps while targeting a domain list, the campaign will be unrestricted
when buying mobile app inventory unless you have also applied App List
targeting. To avoid serving on mobile app inventory, switch the **Apps
Placements** toggle in your campaign's targeting profile to OFF.

Delete a Domain List or App List

You can delete domain lists and app lists from the
Xandr system. Be sure to read the warnings below
before you delete a domain list or app list:



Warning: Deleting a domain or app list
while it's in use by an active campaign will change the targeting of
that campaign. If the list you delete is the only one in use by the
campaign, and that campaign does not have individual targeting settings,
the result will be a campaign with no targeting, also known as
"Targeting the internet." **This is likely to result in massive
overspend.**





Warning: Deleting a domain or app list
is permanent, and deleted lists cannot be restored.



To delete a domain list or app list:

1.  Select
    Network
     \>  Inventory  \>
     Targeting Lists from the
    top navigation menu.
2.  Select Domain Lists or
    App Lists tab.
3.  Check the checkbox next to one or more domain lists or app lists.
4.  Select
    Actions
     \>  Delete. A
    confirmation dialog will appear. Be sure you really want to delete
    them before clicking Delete. Lists
    cannot be recovered once deleted.
5.  Click Delete.
