# Microsoft Invest - Get deals from seller packages

As a buyer, the best way to find deals is to browse sellers' packages, which are pre-made combinations of inventory and/or data that can be immediately converted into deals or can be used as a jumping-off point for custom deal negotiations. This page walks you through the process.

## Step 1. Browse seller packages

Go to the **Package Marketplace** screen (**Inventory** > **Package Marketplace**) and browse through available packages from sellers. The following details display for each package:

- **Package Name** - The seller's name for the package.
- **Seller Name** - The name of the seller offering the package.
- **Price** - The price, if any, associated with the package. This is the minimum amount you must bid in order to compete for the packaged
 contents.
- **Contents Tags** - The Context, Audience, and Sizes tags display when the package contains selected inventory, segments, and sizes respectively. Hover over the details icon (eye) on the Sizes tag to view a list of the sizes included in the package.
- **Description** - The seller's description of the inventory and/or data included in the package.

Use the filters on the left to hone in on offers that meet your needs:

- **Filter by Sellers** - Select specific sellers to view the packages they offer.
- **Search for a Package** - Search package names and descriptions using keywords.
- **Filter by Package** - Select package contents that meet your needs.

## Step 2. Get deals

Once you've found packages that you are interested in, there are two ways to get targetable deals. You can either instantly generate deals from packages "off-the-shelf," or you can ask sellers to customize packages to meet your needs.

### Option 1. Generate deals "off-the-shelf"

Click **Add to Cart** next to each package that you want to convert into a deal. Then click **Get Deals** to instantly convert the packages into deals between you and the seller and to receive deal IDs that you can target.

### Option 2. Request a custom deal

If you are interested in a package but would like to ask the seller to make modifications, click **Request a Custom Deal**, enter your message, and then click **Submit**. Your message will be posted in the seller's [Partnership Details Screen](./partnership-details-screen-buyer-view.md). Continue to use the Activity Stream to negotiate with the seller.

## Step 3. Target deals

If you generated a deal from a package, your deal ID is displayed in the **Selected Packages**
section. Target deals using line item deal targeting. For more information, see [Deal Targeting (ALI)](./deal-targeting-ali.md).
