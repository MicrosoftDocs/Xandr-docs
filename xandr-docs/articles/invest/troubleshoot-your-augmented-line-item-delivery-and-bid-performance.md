# Troubleshoot your augmented line item delivery and bid performance

You can improve your augmented line item (ALI) delivery and impression count, which in return will help you win more bids, by accessing the **Troubleshooting** tab and reviewing all top issues and bid performance messages.

1. Navigate to the **[Line Item Details](view-line-item-details.md)** pane.
1. Click the **Troubleshooting** tab.

    A prioritized list of top issues that are preventing your ALI from delivering may display in the **Top Issues** section. Top issues may include any of the following:
    - Unaudited creative
    - Inactive insertion order
    - Inactive line item

1. To resolve these issues, click the pencil icon that displays next to each issue.

    You'll be automatically taken to the appropriate screen to make the necessary adjustments in most cases.

1. Go to the **Bid Performance** section to gain insight into how your bids are performing.

    A list of bid performance messages may display in the **Bid Performance** section if your bid performance is underperforming. These messages will be prioritized within any one of these bid performance categories: member targeting, line item targeting, creative, bid value, and auction. For additional information, see [Bid Performance Messages for Augmented Line Items](bid-performance-messages-for-augmented-line-items.md).

    If you arenâ€™t seeing any bid performance messages, ensure that the appropriate supply strategy is selected from the **Supply Strategy** menu. The **Supply Strategy** menu defaults to what was selected when setting up the ALI. If more than one supply strategy was selected, the default priority will be based on the order in which the supply strategies fall on the **Create Line Item** and **Edit Line Item** screens as follows:
    - **Open Exchange**
    - **Managed**
    - **Deals**

1. Select a different supply strategy if the default is causing unexpected results.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you're expecting bid performance messages but still don't see any, please contact your account manager.

1. Click any one of the bid performance categories to gain insight into how your settings are affecting your bid performance.

    A yellow triangle will display if there are corresponding bid performance messages.

1. Click the information icons that display next to the bid performance message to obtain additional information about what's happening  (reason) and suggested recommendations for improving your bid performance.
1. Click any one of buttons that display below to make the necessary adjustments if desired.

    You'll be automatically taken to the appropriate screen to make the necessary adjustments in most cases.
