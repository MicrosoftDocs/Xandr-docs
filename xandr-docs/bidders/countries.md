# Countries

Clicking the **Countries** tab accesses a screen where you can select which countries or regions you want to receive. You can either **include** or **exclude** the desired countries or regions by clicking either the **green checkmark icon** (include), or the **red minus sign icon** (exclude).

The **magnifying glass/search icon** can be used to search for the desired country or region to include or exclude. Begin typing the name of the country or region you want, and this list will narrow down to your specific choice.

When you close the **Countries** tab, a summary is shown in the upper right-hand corner of the **Countries** display bar that shows that you've applied some sort of targeting. *(Example:Â 1 Country Included).*
