# Inventory Quality Targeting





<b>Note:</b> This form of targeting is only
available to Standard Line Items. For an overview of which targeting
options are available to Standard versus Augmented Line items, see

In the Inventory Quality section of a
campaign, you can determine how restrictive your campaign will be about
the inventory it serves on.

- **Serve only on Xandr-reviewed inventory** -
  This is the most restrictive option and is selected by default. You
  will serve only on high-traffic domains that
  Xandr has reviewed for sensitive attributes
  and intended audience. You will therefore have less volume but better
  inventory quality assurance.
- **Also serve on trusted seller-reviewed/unreviewed inventory** - This
  is less restrictive. In addition to serving on
  Xandr-reviewed inventory, you will also serve
  on seller-reviewed and unreviewed inventory from sellers that you have
  trusted in your Seller Eligibility settings. See
  <a href="edit-seller-defaults.md" class="xref">Edit Seller
  Defaults</a> for more details.
- **Serve on any inventory** - This is the least restrictive option. You
  will serve on all inventory (Xandr-reviewed,
  seller-reviewed, and unreviewed) from all eligible sellers.



<b>Note:</b> By default, inventory quality
filtering is enabled to allow platform-reviewed inventory. Since the
majority of third-party mobile web inventory comes from external supply
sources and is not platform-reviewed, the best way to reach this
inventory is to turn off inventory quality filtering.

Inventory Quality does not apply to in-app inventory. Mobile campaigns
will deliver on in-app inventory, regardless of your campaign's
Inventory Quality setting.





<b>Important:</b> Regardless of your inventory
quality settings, you will never serve on sellers that you have blocked
in your Seller Eligibility settings. For more details, see
<a href="edit-seller-defaults.md" class="xref">Edit Seller
Defaults</a>.



If you choose to serve on Xandr-reviewed or
seller-reviewed inventory, you can click the
Edit button to further expand your
reach to target inventory that has been flagged (by
Xandr or by the seller) with sensitive
attributes and intended audiences.
