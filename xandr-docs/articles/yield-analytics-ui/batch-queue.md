# Batch Queue



Clicking the Batch Queue tab accesses
any batches that are running or have completed during the current day.



## Retrieving a Batch

- Clicking Run on the Batch Builder
  screen moves that batch to the Batch Queue.
- There are the following columns displayed: Name, Created By, Progress.
- The Name column indicates the
  number of lookups in the batch, to the right of the batch name.
- Progress is a percentage bar. Hover over the Progress result for
  additional batch run information. (Example: XX out of XX lookups
  completed).
- Click the sprocket icon to the left of the batch to access these
  options:
  - Edit in Batch Builder - This will open the batch lookups in the
    Batch Builder screen so you can make changes and rerun the batch.
  - Export to Excel
  - Export to CSV
  - Custom Export
- If you just want to view the results that were run against these
  lookups, click the batch Name result itself, (it is hyperlinked). 
  This accesses the Lookup Results page, where you can see
  availability and capacity data. 
- If the batch was configured to be emailed either on a scheduled or ad
  hoc basis, an envelope icon within the
  Progress field will indicate the
  batch was sent successfully.





## Canceling a Batch

Batches that are not yet complete may be canceled. If you have the
proper permission you may use the Cancel
All button on the top right-hand side of the screen to cancel all
incomplete batches at once. Alternatively, you can cancel an individual
batch by rolling over the sprocket icon and clicking
Cancel, if you have the permission to
do so for the given batch.



<b>Tip:</b> Note

Any batches created that day stay within the batch queue table for the
day.

The Batch Queue is viewable to everybody. If you have proper
permissions, you will be able to view all the batches that are being run
by all users.
