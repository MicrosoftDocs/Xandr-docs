## Example

### Create the JSON-formatted report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` `"seller_invoice_report"`, as well as the `columns` (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filters for specific dimensions, define granularity (year, month, day), and specify the `format` in which the data should be returned (`csv`, `excel`, or `html`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](report-service.md).

``` 
$ cat report {
            "report": { "report_type": "seller_invoice_report", "timezone": "PST",
            "report_interval": "last_7_days", "name": "SSP Monthly Buyer Report", "columns": [
            "day", "seller_member", "publisher_id", "publisher_name", "publisher_code",
            "buyer_member_id", "buyer_member_name", "imps", "imps_delivered", "seller_revenue" ] }
            }
```

> [!NOTE]
> To order by day, insert this object into your JSON file after the "columns" array: `"orders": ["day"]`

### `POST` the request to the Reporting Service

``` 
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies
            -X POST -d @report 'https://api.appnexus.com/report' {
            "response": { "status": "OK", "report_id": "bfe2ba2ea54a51115db942d591a7b5d9" }
            }
```

### `GET` the report status from the Report Service

Make a `GET` call with the Report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `{{execution_status}}`is `"ready"`. Then use the \*report-download\* service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

``` 
$ curl -b cookies -c
            cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=bfe2ba2ea54a51115db942d591a7b5d9' { "response":{ "status":"OK",
            "report":{ "name":null, "created_on":"2010-05-25 19:19:53", "url":
            "report-download?id=bfe2ba2ea54a51115db942d591a7b5d9" }, "execution_status":"ready" }
            }
```

### `GET` the report data from the Report Download Service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the Report ID, but this time to the \*report-download\* service. You can find the service and Report ID in the `{{url}}` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the "format" that you specified in your initial `POST`.

- If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `{{-i}}` or `{{-v}}` in your call to expose the response header.
- Use the ID that was given in the response from when you initially posted the report.

``` 
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies
                  'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=bfe2ba2ea54a51115db942d591a7b5d9' >
               report.csv
```
