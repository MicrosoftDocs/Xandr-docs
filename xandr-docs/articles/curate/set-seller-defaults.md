# Microsoft Curate - Set seller defaults

On the **Partner Center** Screen, the **Default Settings** option allows you to establish default inventory trust settings for all sellers. It is possible to override these settings for individual sellers. For details, see [Edit Seller Defaults](edit-seller-defaults.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Inventory trust settings only apply to standard line item targeting.

## Step 1: Get started

Go to the **Partner Center** screen (**Partners \> Partner Center**) and click on the **Default Settings** button to display the Default Settings dialog.

## Step 2: Update your default settings

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Changes to the Partner Center**
>
> New sellers are eligible (that is, available for buying) by default in **Partner Center**, and we have removed the ability to set default eligibility to **Blocked**. Though default eligibility options are no longer available, no **Partner Center** blocks set before March 10, 2016 have changed.
>
> AppNexus Direct sellers can only be blocked using domain or campaign exclusions.
> [!TIP]
> **Get to Know AppNexus Direct**
>
> AppNexus Direct is a group of 100+ sellers we have identified as mostly selling owned and operated inventory or selling through exclusive relationships with publishers.
>
> For more information, please see [AppNexus Direct](appnexus-direct-for-buyers.md) or contact your Xandr account manager.
> [!NOTE]
> **Unblocking AppNexus Direct Sellers**
>
> Once you unblock an AppNexus Direct seller, you cannot reinstate blocking for that seller in the **Partner Center**.

The **Default Inventory Trust** setting indicates whether you trust inventory reviewed only by the Xandr platform (**Platform-reviewed**), by the Xandr platform and the seller (**Seller-reviewed**), or all inventory (**All**). For more information on the different inventory trust levels, see the **Setting default inventory trust** section in [Partner Center Screen](partner-center-screen-buyer-view.md).
