# Anatomy of the Availability Dashboard Page



The Availability Dashboard page is the primary view for
the Availability tab. This provides a
summary of available revenue, available sell-through, and how available
inventory is trending. It is displayed automatically when you click
the Availability tab.

## About the Availability Dashboard Interface

The Availability Dashboard page is comprised of the following three
widgets:

- Available Revenue – Displays available revenue (calculated
  as Impressions × Rate Card) for the top-performing products in a given
  product group for a given time period (next three months by default).
  You can change the product group and the time period in this widget.
- Utilization/Sell-Through – Displays sell-through rate for the
  top-performing products in a given product group, for a given time
  period (next three months by default). You can change the product
  group and time period in this widget.
- Availability Trended – Displays impressions capacity, divided between
  guaranteed and preemptible impressions, across the network or for a
  selected product for a given time period (previous three months and
  next three months by default). You can change the product and time
  period in this widget. You can also filter the graph to show only
  guaranteed impressions or only preemptible impressions.

To the left of the widgets is the Availability Tasks panel. This is
where you can select between three options to check for available
inventory:

- Check Availability – Takes you to the Availability Lookup page. This
  is where you can search for available inventory by product and/or
  across products by one or more attributes. You can also create batch
  lookups from this page to search availability across multiple sets of
  product criteria.
- View Calendar – Takes you to the View Calendar page. This is where you
  can view daily availability for a given month to find openings for new
  deals. This is especially useful for sponsorships. 
- View Batch Lookups – Takes you to the Batch Lookups page. This is
  where you can check the status of your availability batch lookups and
  review completed availability batch lookups (also referred to as
  "availability reports"). You can export batch lookups to Excel
  worksheet (XLS) or comma-separated values (CSV) files.

The Availability Tasks panel is the Processing Summary panel. This is a
read-only panel that indicates when the availability forecast and order
data were last updated.
