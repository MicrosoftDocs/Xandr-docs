# Microsoft Curate - Custom margins

You can customize margins for each split if your Curate seat and user have the necessary permissions. Follow the steps below to enable and configure custom margins.

1. If your Curate seat and user are permissioned to take a margin, the **Use Custom Margins** checkbox will be available. Check the box to add the **Margin** column to the splits entry grid.
1. By default, each split will use the same margin value defined for your deal line item in the **Basic Settings** section. You can override this margin value by setting a specific value on each split.
1. Your splits always use the same **Margin Type**—either percentage or CPM—that you’ve selected for your deal line item in the **Basic Settings** section.
