# Multi-key value analytics report

The Multi-Key Value Analytics report shows you the information associated with your network's defined multiple targeting keys and values.

Impressions with key/value targeting will serve and be reported only for those impressions that were logged by a placement tag containing the **kw\_** prefix on the key name. For example, a placement tag containing `keyname=value1` will not serve and therefore not be logged, whereas a placement tag containing **kw\_**`keyname=value1` will serve
and be logged. This applies to ad calls with the following tag types: `/tt`, `/ttj`, `/fpt`, `/jpt`, `/pt`, `/ptv`, `/ssptv`, `/mtj`, `/map`, and `/mob`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Microsoft Advertising Seller Tags:** When using [Microsoft Advertising's seller tag](../seller-tag/seller-tag.md) (AST), omit the **kw\_** prefix. AST has the keyword object in the body of the request, so the prefix is not needed.

Not all impressions from key/value targets will be included in reports. To be included, the targets must meet the following criteria:

- Key must be pre-defined.
- Value must be pre-defined OR Value must be targeted by at least one
  line item or campaign.
- Value is not a numeric range (greater than or less than).
- Value does not include a wildcard.

## Time frame

All dates and times are given in UTC.

**Time ranges**

**Intervals**

Intervals determine how your data is grouped together into rows in the report response. The following is a complete list of intervals available for reports. However, all intervals are not available for every report.

- Hourly: Data is grouped into rows by the hour.
- Daily: Data is grouped into rows by the day.
- Monthly: Data is grouped into rows by the month.
- Cumulative: Data is grouped together in one figure, covering the entire selected time range.

For more information about how quickly reporting data is processed, see [Availability of Reporting Data](availability-of-reporting-data.md).

## Time ranges including dates occurring greater than 45 days ago

If you create a Multi-Key Value Analytics report with the Range field set to Custom (where the end date is greater than 45 days from today), your report (regardless of metrics included) will be added to a special queue for "resource-intensive" reports. As a result, the report may take longer than usual to complete. In addition, this resource-intensive report may, due to the amount of data being requested, fail before being completed. If your report fails to complete, you will receive a notification. If your report request fails, you can:

- rerun the report at a later time.
- use a report type other than Key Value Analytics.
- alter the way you structure your reports (if possible) so they do not
  include dates greater than 45 days ago.

If you are frequently requesting Multi-Key Value Analytics reports which include dates longer than 45 days ago, you may need to consider running these reports via the API, caching the data and using [Bulk Reporting Feeds](../digital-platform-api/bulk-reporting-feeds.md) or [Log-Level Data Feeds](../log-level-data/log-level-data-feeds.md)(LLD). See
[Dimensions, Metrics, Filtering, and Grouping](dimensions-metrics-filtering-and-grouping.md) for more details on how to alter your reports to avoid these issues.

## To run your report

Follow these steps to run your report.

1. Select **Reporting** from the appropriate top menu (depending on how your account has been configured).
   1. Or, from the Publishers top menu, click on **Prebid Server Premium** \> **Analytics** \> **Prebid Server Analytics**.
1. Select the relevant report from the list. The **Report** screen shows the available filters, dimensions, and delivery options for the report. The selections you make here will determine what report data is delivered to you, and how.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For an explanation of how grouping and filtering work, see [Dimensions, Metrics, Filtering, and Grouping](dimensions-metrics-filtering-and-grouping.md).

1. Select the relevant filters to limit the data displayed to just the information you want. For example, rather than running a report that shows impressions for all inventory sources, you may want to list results for just a select few. When you select a filter (by clicking **Edit**), a selection panel appears.
    a. Select items in the **Available** list (left), then click **Add** to include them in the **Chosen** list (right).
1. Group by Dimension. Grouping allows you to display rows of data in the order you prefer.

    > [!WARNING]
    > The more dimensions you group by, the larger the data set that is returned. Larger data sets can take substantially longer to process. Be sure to group using only the dimensions you need.

1. Choose a delivery option. Once you've selected your filters and grouped by your chosen dimensions, you need to choose a delivery method. Available delivery methods include:
    - **Run now, show results in screen**: For smaller amounts of data, you may want to view the report as soon as possible in your browser. You can download the report in XLSX, CSV, Excel/TSV and JSON format. However, there is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when downloading as XLSX and Excel file.
    - **Run in background, notify me when results are ready to view**: A popup notification will let you know when the report is ready to view or download.

      > [!TIP]
      >  The maximum size of the report that can be downloaded from the UI is 100 MB. Also, there is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when downloading as XLSX and Excel file. If the size of the report is more than that, you can try to download it using the [API](../digital-platform-api/report-service.md) for that reporting service (The limit here is 10 million rows).

    - **Export, send results via email**: Run the report in the background and email the results to one or more email addresses.
    - **Save as report template**: Save your selected report settings so that you can run this report again in the future. You can name this template using the text entry field under **Name this report** (its checkbox is auto-selected when you choose this option). A saved report can be rerun from the **Your Reports** screen.
    - **Add to scheduled reports**: Run this report automatically at specified times and have it sent to one or more email addresses.
    - **Name this report**: Give this report with its current settings a name for future reference.
1. Click **Run report** to send your report request.
