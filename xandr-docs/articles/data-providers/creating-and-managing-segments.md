# Creating and managing segments

Data providers can create and manage their own segments via the
following methods:

1. Create segments using the API [segment service](../digital-platform-api/segment-service.md).
1. Create segments in our [bidder UI](https://bidder.xandr.com/login) (using your API credentials). This method is only available
    to data providers with real-time data bidder integrations.
