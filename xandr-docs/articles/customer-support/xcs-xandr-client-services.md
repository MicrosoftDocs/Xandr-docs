#  Client Services



Welcome to the  Client Services organization.
This guide covers our mission, business relationship with you, issue
resolution process, and other helpful resources.

All requests can be submitted and routed to the appropriate
 team directly from our Customer Support form
located at
<a href="https://help.xandr.com" class="xref" target="_blank">Support
Portal</a>.



## Our Mission

 Client Services is striving to set a new
industry standard for customer responsiveness and communication. We
achieve our higher standard in a few ways:

1.  We are your single point of contact for technical problems with the
     platform. Whether the issue can be resolved
    quickly or requires a long-term engineering fix, we will communicate
    with you until it's fully resolved.
2.  On an ongoing basis, Client Services shares with you the best
    practices and helpful tips we've learned. We are a frequent
    contributor to the  email list. We also
    provide free product training as part of the
     Customer Webinar Program.
3.   Client Services are provided at no
    additional cost to  customers. If you have
    any question, please be sure to reach out to your
     Account Representative.





## You and Client Services: A Partnership

It is our highest priority to help you succeed, and we aim to surpass
your expectations of us as a service organization. This includes
resolving technical issues quickly and effectively, giving helpful
advice, and working hard to provide a stable and reliable technology
platform for your business. We also aim to provide comprehensive and
informative documentation to enable our customers to be more
self-sufficient. We view our relationship with you as a partnership. In
the spirit of that partnership, there are a few things that you can do
to help us to more effectively service you:

1.  Please review our relevant articles prior to submitting a support
    request. The <a href="https://docs.xandr.com" class="xref"
    target="_blank">documentation help center</a> is a massive source of
    information that we have dedicated significant effort into building
    out as a customer resource.
2.  Please do as much research and triaging of issues as possible before
    submitting a request to our team. Your upfront effort will
    ultimately help us to resolve your issues faster.
3.  Please contact your internal  subject matter
    expert, or “SME”, with potential technical issues. Your
     SME will be able to assist you with
    confirming the issue and constructing an informative support request
    to our team.
4.  After you have performed a thorough investigation on your end,
    please include the following detailed information in your support
    request:
    1.  Description of the problem, including as much detail as
        possible, and the impact on your immediate goals
    2.  All relevant object IDs
    3.  Environment details (bidder id, member id, creative id, etc)
    4.  Steps to reproduce the problem, including test pages, URLs, etc.
    5.  Screenshot(s) for all UI-related issues
    6.  Browser and Operating System used (including version numbers)





## What types of requests should go to Client Services?

The Client Services team is your single point of contact for all
technical issues pertaining to our ad platform. We are excited to help
you leverage our technology to drive success for your business. We are
here to reinforce best practices taught during your initial training,
help to correct day-to-day issues occurring across your buying or
selling, and to identify and resolve any product bugs or gaps. We will
dig deeply into any unexpected behavior that you may find and work
together with our Engineering team to ensure that we provide the most
stable and efficient ad platform possible.  
The  platform is constantly evolving to meet the
varied needs of our growing customer base. Our Product and Engineering
teams are dedicated to releasing useful features to help our customers
drive more success on the platform, however we recognize that we do not
have the capacity to deliver on every product enhancement request that
we receive. Our Client Services team is available to make important
configuration changes or to pull necessary data sets in cases where
specific functionality is not currently available in our product and
there is a corresponding strong business justification for the request.

**In summary, the request types will be directed via the support form to
the following teams as shown below:**

customer's behalf.

**Standard Issues**

button in  UI which should be enabled.
