# July 14, 2021: New targeting enhancements

We are introducing the ability to target postal code lists and deal lists at the line item and split level. From our **Location Manager**,
you can easily create postal code lists by grouping various postal codes together into one list at the member level. From our **Inventory menu**, you can easily create deal lists by grouping various deal IDs together into one list at the member and advertiser level.

For more information, see:

- [Postal Code Lists](postal-code-lists.md)
- [Additional Geo Restrictions (ALI)](additional-geo-restrictions-ali.md)
- [Deal Lists](deal-lists.md)
- [Deal Targeting (ALI)](deal-targeting-ali.md)
