## Viewing pulse data

It's easy to display Pulse metrics for your campaigns. From the **Campaigns** screen, click the **Pulse** button.

This reveals three columns - one containing sparklines, one containing spend in the last 60 seconds, and one containing impressions - that show how your campaigns are spending.

## Understanding pulse data

The sparklines show how each campaign has been spending minute-by-minute for the last 30 minutes. The orange dots on the sparkline indicate the high and low points of spending in the last 30 minutes, as well as the current spend.

You can also click on a sparkline to see it enlarged in a separate dialog.

## Troubleshooting with pulse

When Pulse is activated for your campaigns, you can easily see if a campaign has stopped spending. A flat line is an indication that your campaign has run into delivery issues.

If you see a flat sparkline for any of your campaigns, you can click the edit icon in-line for that campaign to change [Update Campaigns](update-campaigns.md), or click the graph icon to view [View Campaign Details](view-campaign-details.md) and assess for trouble spots.

When you make adjustments, they take effect in about 10 minutes - this is the time it takes for them to propagate to the ad server. Once your changes are in effect, you can see whether they improved campaign delivery right away.

With Pulse, you can see and address campaign delivery issues promptly, helping to ensure that your campaigns are spending effectively throughout their lifespans.
