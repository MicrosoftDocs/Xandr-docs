# Vertical Video Creatives



Vertical video formats are designed for display on smartphones, and use
an aspect ratio that can either be square, or longer than it is wide.
For example, unlike a traditional tall creative for HDTV measuring 1920
x 1080 pixels, a vertical version might be 1080 pixels wide and 1920
pixels tall. A square video creative might be 600 x 600 pixels.
Xandr supports vertical video for out-stream and
side-stream play.

Vertical videos can be displayed either in a "native" or full-screen
mode. Native mode displays the video alongside other on-screen content.
Full-screen mode shows video controls overlaid on the creative. In
either case, the video is displayed in its true vertical aspect ratio,
without pillarboxing or letterboxing.



Note: When creating new line items for
your vertical video creatives, be sure to set the
Creative Type to
Video and the
Supply Strategy to
Managed or
Open Exchange. For more information,
