## Examples

### Create the JSON-formatted report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` `bidder_platform_buyer`, as well as the `columns` (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the format in which the data should be returned (`csv`, `excel`, or `html`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](report-service.md).

```
$ cat report
{
    "report": {
        "report_type": "bidder_platform_buyer",
        "timezone": "PST",
        "report_interval": "last_7_days",
        "name": "Example Buyer Report",
        "columns": [
            "day",
            "publisher_id",
            "publisher_name",
            "publisher_code",
            "buyer_member_id",
            "buyer_member_name",
            "buyer_ecpm",
            "buyer_spend"
        ]
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> To order by day, insert this object into your JSON file after the "columns" array:
>
> ```
> "orders": ["day"]
> ```

### `POST` the request to the reporting service

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @report 'https://api.adnxs.com/report'
{
  "response": {
    "status": "OK",
    "report_id": "bfe2ba2ea54a51115db942d591a7b5d9",
  }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service

Make a `GET` call with the Report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.adnxs.com/report?id=bfe2ba2ea54a51115db942d591a7b5d9'
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report":{
         "name":null,
         "created_on":"2010-05-25 19:19:53",
         "url": "report-download?id=bfe2ba2ea54a51115db942d591a7b5d9"
      },
      "execution_status":"ready"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the Report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and Report ID in the `url` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!NOTE]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use {{-i}} or {{-v}} in your call to expose the response header.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.adnxs.com/report-download?id=bfe2ba2ea54a51115db942d591a7b5d9' > report.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> Use the ID that was given in the response from when you initially posted the report.
