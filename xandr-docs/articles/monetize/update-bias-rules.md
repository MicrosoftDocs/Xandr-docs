<b>Note:</b> This feature is not available by
default. If you are interested in gaining access or discussing potential
use cases that may apply to your business, reach out to your
Xandr representative.



The Bias Rule Manager screen lists all
bias rules for the publisher, allows you to view and edit rule details,
and offers bulk editing options.

Getting to the Bias Rule Manager Screen

To reach this screen, select
Publishers
 \>  Bias Rules from the
navigation menu, and then select a publisher when you are prompted.

Viewing Bias Rule Details

To view details about a bias rule, select the rule by clicking anywhere
in the row except the checkbox. The Bias
Settings section then shows you the following:

- **Bias Direction** The type of bias applied to a buyer or buyer group;
  positive (bid preference), negative (bid deterrent), or neutral (no
  bias applied).
- **Applied To** The number of buyers or buyer groups that the bias
  direction has been applied to.

The Rule Details section then shows
you the following:

- Name The name that you provided for
  the rule.
- ID The rule's ID.
- Priority The rule's priority. Rules
  are checked against the impression in priority order.

For conditional bias rules, the Rule
Details section will also display the following (not shown in
screen shot):

- Audience Targeting An overview of
  the rule's audience targeting settings.
- Supply Targeting An overview of the
  rule's supply targeting settings.

Filtering by Name/ID

You can find all bias rules whose names or IDs include a specific string
of characters or numbers. Click Filter
and then enter the characters in the
Name/ID field.

<b>Warning:</b> Be careful when deleting bias
rules. As soon as a rule is deleted it **immediately** stops applying to
transactions; this may have significant revenue repercussions.
