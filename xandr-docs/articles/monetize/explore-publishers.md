# Explore Publishers





The Publishers screen lists the
publishers with which your member is associated. In this list you can
see information regarding network and publisher performance for each
publisher. You can select individual publishers to display more
information.

Getting to the Publisher Screen



<b>Note:</b> Depending on which version of
Monetize you use, you will access the
Publishers screen using one of the
following options.



From the Publishers tab: either select
the Publishers option in the menu at
the top of the screen, or select All
Publishers from the Publishers
dropdown.

From the Inventory tab: either select
the **Inventory** option in the menu at the top of the screen, or select
Publishers from the
Inventory dropdown.

Reviewing Publisher Performance

You can select the time period you want to review by clicking the date
selector above the table. You can choose to view data from
Today,
Yesterday,
Last 7 Days, or
Lifetime.

The following information about the activity of each publisher
associated to your member is available in the
Publishers table:

- Name - The name of the publisher.
- ID - The unique identification
  number of the publisher.
- Placements - The number of
  placements defined for the publisher. This information is displayed on
  a button; clicking this button will take you to the
  Placement Manager for that
  publisher. (See
  <a href="explore-placements.md" class="xref">Explore Placements</a>
  for more on using the Placement Manager.)
- Currency - The currency units being
  displayed for the publisher. The default is USD (United States
  Dollar). You can change your settings to display all currency values,
  such as Revenue and Profit, in the local currency of each publisher.
  Note that as with all columns on this screen you can hide the Currency
  column from view. See Configuring Publisher Display below for
  information on configuring the currencies and columns that are
  displayed.
- Network (member name) -
  - Revenue - The total revenue for
    the network. This value includes the sum of booked and resold
    revenue.
  - RPM - The revenue per 1,000
    impressions for the network. This value includes impressions from
    defaults, <a href="default-psas.md" class="xref">Public Service
    Announcements</a> (PSAs), and errors.
  - Profit - The dollar amount that
    this network has earned from this publisher.
  - PPM - The network profit per 1,000
    impressions (Network RPM - Publisher RPM).
  - Deal Revenue - The total revenue
    from deals.
- **Publisher's Share**
  

  <b>Important:</b> For publishers with an
  inventory relationship of Owned &
  Operated, Publisher Revenue
  and RPM will always be zero. The
  amount made on inventory is rolled up into the
  Network Revenue column, which
  represents the revenue earned by your Xandr
  member seat.

  

  - Revenue - The total revenue earned
    by this publisher. This value represents the network's cost.

    impressions for this publisher. This value includes impressions from
    defaults, PSAs, and errors. It represents your network's CPM.
- Impressions
  - Imps - The total number of
    impressions.
  - Kept - This value applies to
    managed accounts. It reflects the number of managed advertiser's
    creatives served on a managed publisher's site.

    resold to a third-party buyer.
  - Default - The number of
    impressions where a

    class="xref">default creative</a> served because there were no valid
    bids.
  - PSA - The number of impressions
    that showed PSAs. PSAs serve only when there is no other creative
    available.
- **Viewability**
  

  <b>Important:</b> A viewable impression, as
  defined by the IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau), is a display ad
  with 50% or more of the pixels visible for at least one continuous
  second. A video ad is defined as viewable if 50% or more of the pixels
  are visible for at least two consecutive seconds.

  

  - Viewable - The percentage of
    impressions that were viewable, based on the total number of
    impressions that were measured for viewability.
  - Measured - The percentage of
    impressions measured for viewability, based on the total number of
    impressions.
  - Clicks - The total number of
    clicks on all impressions for this publisher.

Configuring Publisher Display

Click the configuration button (in the upper right corner of the screen)
to customize the display of your publisher list. Several display options
are available.

Column Configuration

Configure which columns you'll see in the
Publishers table. All columns are
visible by default. Uncheck the category (**Network**, **Publisher**,
**Impressions**, **Viewability**) to hide all columns within that
category. Checking the category will restore all columns along with the
category. Check and uncheck individual columns within categories
depending on your view preferences.

Currency Display

Select whether to view currency units for each publisher in
USD: United States Dollar or the
Local Currency of the publisher. Local
currency is determined by the currency settings for each publisher.
Current exchange rates will be applied. Exchange rates are updated
hourly. See
<a href="currency-support.md" class="xref">Currency Support</a> for
more information on currencies.

Time Zone Display

Click the  dropdown to select a time
zone. This will be the time zone that is used to determine the data
collected for the specified time period
(Today,
Yesterday, or
Last 7 Days).

Filtering by Publisher Name/ID

You can limit the number of publishers visible on the screen by
searching for a Publisher by name or ID. In the text box labeled
ID/Name, enter either an ID or a name. The system will automatically
begin searching for matches to whatever you type. For example, if you
type 123, all publishers with IDs containing the numbers 123 (in that
order) will be displayed. If you type Pub1, all publishers whose names
begin with "Pub1" will be displayed.

To see all publishers (or, if you have used the search text box to
filter your list, all publishers that match that search), select
All from the state dropdown. To see
only active publishers, select Active.
To see only inactive publishers,select **Inactive**.

Sorting the Publisher List

You can sort the list of publishers on almost any column by clicking the
column heading. Keep in mind that if your publisher list is long,
sorting might take a little bit of time. The columns you can sort on
are:

- Name
- ID
- Network category: All columns
- Publisher's Share category:
  Revenue column
- Impressions category: All columns
- Viewability category: All columns
- Clicks



<b>Note:</b> When sorting on any column that
displays values of currency, the sorting will always be done based on
USD. This means that if you've chosen to display each publisher's local
currency, the values might look out of order because of the exchange
rates.
