# Deal Lists





## Introduction

A deal is an agreement between a buyer and a seller that provides
special access to inventory and/or data. Deals are primarily used to
access preferred premium inventory or negotiated inventory. A deal list
is a group of deals IDs categorized under a single heading for targeting
across line items. Deal lists allow inventory specialists to curate
deals inventory for traders as well as to streamline trader workflows,
such as targeting the same set of deals across line items. If deal
grouping requirements change, you can make the changes in the deal list
and all line items will be updated accordingly.





## Manage Deal Lists

You can create and manage Deal Lists at the
Member and Advertiser level. A deal list may
contain one or more deal IDs and a deal ID can be added to multiple deal
lists. However, an ID can be added only once to a single deal list.
While adding or removing deals in a deal list, you can find the deals by
deal id, deal name or deal alias. Additionally, deal IDs can be added to
a list in bulk.

    Deal Lists from the dropdown.

        Select whether the deal list is specific to particular
        advertisers, or if it is available to all advertisers under the

        advertisers, enter the advertiser details by searching for the
        name or ID of the advertisers. You can add one or more
        advertisers in this field.
