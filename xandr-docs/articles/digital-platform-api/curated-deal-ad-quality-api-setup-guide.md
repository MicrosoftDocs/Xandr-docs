# Curated deal ad quality API setup guide

Curated deals offer a range of ad quality settings, granting control over what demand can serve through a curated deal. The updated suite of ad quality settings for curators provide robust controls at both the deal and member levels. Configured uniquely, these updated ad quality settings are currently accessible solely through the API. This guide explains how you can start using them.

## Overview

The ad quality settings are specified within a dedicated object known as an ad profile. This ad profile is subsequently linked with either a curated deal or your curator member.

The primary benefits of utilizing ad profiles with curated deals include:

- These settings can be configured to permit or restrict attributes such as brands, brand categories, creative ad servers, landing pages, and languages at either the curated deal or curator member level. Unlike legacy ad quality settings, which could only be configured to allow brands.

- Curators can easily discern which ad quality controls were employed for a specific deal.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Ad quality controls are implemented in an auction either at the member-level or deal-level, but not through a combination of both.

- Curators can assess the potential revenue impact of their ad quality controls.
- They offer the ability to allow or block creative ad servers, granting curators control over which creative pixels can serve through their deals.

| Auction  | Curator member’s ad profile  | Curated deal’s ad profile  | Ad profile used to evaluate bids against curated deal  |
|---|---|---|---|
| A  | 123  |   | 123  |
| B  |   | 456  | 456  |
| C  | 123  | 456  | 456  |

> [!NOTE]
>
> - In an auction, only one ad profile will be utilized and an ad profile associated with your deal supersedes an ad profile associated with your member.
> - In auction C, the platform does not combine ad profiles 123 and 456. Instead, only ad profile 456 is utilized to assess eligible bids against the deal.

## REST API

| API Endpoint | API Object | Detailed Reference |
|---|---|---|
| `https://api.appnexus.com/auth` | auth | [Authentication Service](authentication-service.md) |
| `https://api.appnexus.com/ad-profile` | ad profile | [Ad Profile Service](ad-profile-service.md) |
| `https://api.appnexus.com/deal` | deal | [Deal Service](deal-service.md) |

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this setup, familiarize yourself with the foundational concepts outlined in the following pages. These concepts are essential prerequisites before delving into Curated Deal Ad Quality settings.

- [API Getting Started](api-getting-started.md) - It provides information on testing environments, usage constraints, API semantics (running commands, filtering, sorting, etc.), and best practices.
- [Curated Deal Line Item API Setup Guide](curated-deal-line-item-api-setup-guide.md) - It explains the steps to create a curated deal line item and its associated deal object.

## Best practices

- You can utilize both legacy ad quality settings and new ad quality settings concurrently on the same deal. Nevertheless, for streamlined maintenance and troubleshooting purposes, we advise exclusively employing the updated ad quality settings.
- Utilize the [Curator Bid Error report](curator-bid-error-report.md) to monitor errors caused by ad quality settings and determine if they unintentionally block demand.
- The ad quality settings are defined on an ad profile object linked to a deal. You can reuse the same ad profile across multiple deals, simplifying the maintenance of your ad quality settings overall.
- If you're utilizing an ad profile for your curator member and need to create an exception for a buyer, you can assign an ad profile to their curated deal. This action will fully substitute your curator member's ad profile in the auction for this deal. Ensure you retain any member-level ad quality settings you wish to preserve on your curated deal.

## Setup procedure

    See the [Authentication Service](authentication-service.md) for steps to authenticate.

1. Create an ad profile.
