# Anatomy of the orders dashboard page

The Orders Dashboard page is the primary view for the **Orders** tab. This provides a summary of revenue against goal, consumed impressions, and how orders are performing. It is displayed automatically when you click the **Orders** tab.

## About the orders dashboard interface

The **Orders Dashboard** is comprised of the following three widgets:

- **Revenue Against Goal** – Displays the difference between earned revenue and scheduled revenue in absolute terms for each order, order line, or advertiser for the selected date range. Click an order or order line to open a detailed view at the order's performance, as well as its order lines' consumption and competition.
- **Consumed Impressions** – Displays a pie chart of the percentage of consumed impressions by order, order line, or advertiser for the specified date range.
- **Order performance** – Displays multiple performance metrics filtered by order or order line, for the selected date range (the default is for the previous day). You can click on a specific order or order line to open a detailed view at the order's performance, as well as its order lines' consumption and competition.

For each widget, you can:

- Click **Reset** to reset the widget.
- Click **View All** to run the related full report (e.g., Saved Analysis - Impressions At Risk) in the **Reports** tab.

To the left of the widgets is the **Orders Tasks** panel, which contains links to find orders and order lines, and to evaluate orders.

- **Find Orders** – Takes you to the **Find Orders** page. This is where you can search for an order, view its details, and add it to a scenario.
- **Find Order Lines** – Takes you to the **Find Order Lines** page. This is where you can search for an order line, view its details, and add it to a scenario.
- **Evaluate Orders** – Takes you to the **Evaluate Orders Search** page. This is where you can begin the process of analyzing potential yield.

Below the Orders Tasks panel is the Processing Summary panel. This is a read-only panel that shows the number of orders and order lines for which yield analytics is forecasting delivery, as well as when the delivery forecast was last updated.
