# Bidders - Creative macro check service

If you are running third party creatives, you can use this service to allow Xandr to check third party tags and append parameters in the query string, replace the domain, or insert Xandr click tracking macros in the appropriate place for you. We currently support the following ad servers: MediaMind, Atlas, Fetchback, and DoubleClick.

If we are able to insert the Xandr macros, then the new tag or URL will be returned in the response. If we are unable to ensure that the right macro was inserted (the value in the `existing_other_macros` or `unmatched` fields is not 0 within the response), then the value within the `new_content` or `new_media_url` field will not be displayed in.
