# Associate Creatives with a Line Item



From the Creatives section, you
can associate creatives with an augmented line item (ALI), schedule when
the creatives will serve, determine how the creatives will rotate
through line item inventory, and optionally add creative landing page
URLs.



1.  Select a
    <a href="creative-rotation-ali.md" class="xref"
    title="When multiple creatives of the same size are trafficked to a line item, you can set a creative delivery strategy using the Creative Rotation settings in the Associated Creatives section on the Create New Line Item and Edit Line Item screens.">creative
    rotation strategy</a> to set the rotation strategy for multiple
    creatives of the same size that will be trafficked to the
    ALI:
    <table
    id="ID-000019db__choicetable_be2c8f95-b3db-4b78-99e0-001bac681fef"
    class="simpletable choicetable choicetableborder" data-border="1"
    data-frame="hsides" data-rules="rows" data-cellpadding="4"
    data-cellspacing="0" data-summary="">
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead class="thead">
    <tr class="header sthead chhead">
    <th class="stentry choptionhd" scope="col"
    style="text-align: left; vertical-align: bottom;">Radio Button</th>
    <th class="stentry chdeschd" scope="col"
    style="text-align: left; vertical-align: bottom;">Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd strow chrow">
    <th class="stentry choption" style="vertical-align: top"
    scope="row">Auto-optimize creative weight</th>
    <td class="stentry chdesc" style="vertical-align: top">The creative with
    the highest click-through-rate (CTR) delivers the most.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even strow chrow">
    <th class="stentry choption" style="vertical-align: top"
    scope="row">Evenly weight creatives</th>
    <td class="stentry chdesc" style="vertical-align: top">Our system will
    evenly serve creatives of the same size.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd strow chrow">
    <th class="stentry choption" style="vertical-align: top"
    scope="row">Manually weight creatives</th>
    <td class="stentry chdesc" style="vertical-align: top">Rotation is based
    on a user-supplied weight.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even strow chrow">
    <th class="stentry choption" style="vertical-align: top"
    scope="row">Inherit creative weight from splits</th>
    <td class="stentry chdesc" style="vertical-align: top">Rotation is based
    on a user-supplied weight defined per split.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    

    If you're using a <a
    href="advanced-ads-toolset/custom-models.md"
    class="xref" target="_blank">custom model</a> to deliver creatives,
    a message will display in the
    Creatives section identifying
    the model attached.

    
2.  Associate the appropriate creatives to your ALI
    by doing one of the following:
    - Enter a name or ID of an existing creative in the
      Search creative name or ID
      search field, and select the corresponding checkboxes that
      display. You can also narrow your search by choosing a creative
      folder from the dropdown.
      

      <b>Tip:</b> You can also place your
      cursor in the Search creative name or
      ID search field and existing creatives that are associated
      to the same advertiser as the ALI will display.

      
    - Select the Paste List of IDs
      button and enter all the associated creative IDs separated by
      commas or hard returns in the modal and click
      Add.

    

    Each associated creative displays at the bottom of the
    Associated Creatives
    subsection, with associated active creatives on the first tab and
    associated inactive creatives on the second tab. Creatives will
    automatically serve for all flights unless you apply specific
    flights or custom dates that fall within the date ranges for a
    specific flight. When creatives are scheduled to serve for all
    flights and additional flights are added to the ALI, the creatives
    will continue to serve until the last flight ends.

    
3.  Enter a value in the
    Weight field for each
    corresponding creative if the Manually
    weight creatives radio button was selected.
4.  Select specific flights or custom dates that
    fall within the date ranges for these specific flights to schedule
    when associated creatives will serve by doing the following if
    necessary:
    1.  Select corresponding checkboxes for the
        necessary creatives and click
        Associate dates.
        

        You can select multiple checkboxes if several of the creatives
        will serve during the same flights or custom dates.

        
    2.  Click the Select
        dates button from the
        Associate Dates dialog if the
        creative will serve during specific flights.
    3.  Select any of the available checkboxes to
        apply specific flights, or select the
        Custom date range checkbox and
        select start and end dates to specify a date range that doesn't
        include any dates before the start date or after the end date
        for one of the available flights.
        <div class="itemgroup stepxmp">

        For example, if the flight has a start date of November 1 and an
        end date of December 1, then the custom date range cannot be any
        date before November 1 or after December 1.

        
    4.  Click
        Apply.
5.  Enter a Landing Page
    URL that the user will be redirected to upon clicking each
    creative.
