# Searching the Knowledge Base



Log in to the
<a href="https://help.xandr.com" class="xref" target="_blank">Customer
Support Portal</a> to access your full case history, knowledge base
articles, or request support.

The  Support Knowledge Base contains articles
that answer common questions and explain how to troubleshoot common
issues and perform common tasks. You can browse or search the knowledge
base from multiple locations in the Customer Support Portal.

Knowledge base articles often link to the  wiki
for more detailed information or more complicated tasks.  The wiki
provides an exhaustive overview of  concepts and
features. It includes product documentation, webinars, and training
offerings. The wiki articles open in a new window, so you can navigate
between the knowledge base and the wiki by switching from one window to
another.



<b>Tip:</b> The knowledge base and the wiki
are separate accounts. The first time you click on a link to the wiki,
you may be prompted to log in with your wiki account.
