Microsoft In-market Audiences are curated lists of users determined to be in market and ready to buy within a particular category. These
segments are based on Microsoftâ€™s unique intent signals, including search on Bing and user activity on Microsoft solutions. The power of
search behaviour indicates that the audiences have a high probability of conversion.

In-market Audiences are global, and available in more than 90 markets. Take a look at [Segment Targeting](https://download.microsoft.com/download/4/0/0/40099106-6f9f-4b38-8aac-0dc7567404db/In-Market-Audiences-segment-list-Invest.xlsx) for all the available in-market audience segments.
