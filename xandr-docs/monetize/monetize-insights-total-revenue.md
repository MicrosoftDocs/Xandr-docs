## Navigation bar, global filters and date selection

The Navigation bar located at the top of the **Insights** page allows you to seamlessly switch between **Total Revenue**, offering a comprehensive view of KPIs and trends across all channels, and individual channels. At the global level, you can apply filters that will be effective across all tabs in **Insights**, in addition to choosing specific date ranges, with the flexibility to select a date range spanning up to 31 days ago, and an option to compare it to the immediately preceding time period, as far back as 62 days ago. The data is presented with a daily granularity in the UTC time zone, and the most recent data available corresponds to the prior day once the processing for that day is completed.

## Fidelity of data

Data within **Insights** is presented at a daily granularity in the (UTC) timezone and is updated daily to reflect data from the previous day (UTC). Adjustments for fixed-fee managed line items made on the same day are considered, but adjustments occurring at the end of a multi-day flight are not retrospectively applied. Metric totals are processed to align with reporting figures, with the exception of the brand dimension, which serves as an indicative measure for identifying anomalies.

For the brand dimension, data is processed to reduce data fidelity on long-tail transactions where the daily revenue from a brand on a specific placement is less than $5. In this scenario the revenue, impressions and CPM will be attributed to a category labeled "**Below Threshold**." For precise metrics by brand, it is recommended to utilize reporting tools rather than relying solely on Insights.
