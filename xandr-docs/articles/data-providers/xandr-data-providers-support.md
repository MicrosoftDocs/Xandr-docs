## Training

- [Overview](home.md) - General guidelines on Xandr's role in the data marketplace.
- [Data Marketplace - Data Partner Overview](data-marketplace-data-partner-overview.md) - This is a good place to start if you're interested in becoming a data provider.

## Xandr email communications

Xandr periodically send emails that we think you'll find useful. These can include Marketing Communications (event invitations, white papers), Product and Technical Communications (release notes, service updates), and Training Communications (webinars, live training sessions).

- If you have a Xandr user account, you should receive these communications automatically.
- If you do not have your own Xandr user account, you can [sign up](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/xandr/newsletter-sign-up) to receive these communications.
- If you want to stop receiving Marketing or other Xandr communications, you can update your preferences.
