> With consolidation of Microsoft Advertising to Microsoft family, we have integrated the authentication process of the users (who are using Microsoft Advertising products) to the Microsoft Identity Platform. The profound advantage of this integration is that users would be able use to access Microsoft Advertising applications using the same sign-on methods to access other Microsoft products. Additionally, the integration to the Microsoft Identity Platform enables new and more secure methods of authentication, powered by Microsoft.

As soon as a single credential login has been created for you, you will receive a welcome email with a link for setting your password. You need to use the link and follow below steps to complete your login set-up.

This task explains how to set up your single credential login.

1. Click on the link shared in the welcome mail.
1. Click **Set your password**.
1. After clicking on the link, follow the on-screen prompts to set your password.

    Consider these requirements for setting up your password:
    - Must be at least 8 characters in length.
    - Contains at least 3 of the following 4 types of characters:
      - Lowercase letters (a-z)
      - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
      - Numbers (0-9)
      - Special characters (for example, !@#$%&\*)
      - No more than 2 identical characters in a row (for example, "aaa" not allowed).

If your password meets the above criteria, you will receive a notification that says that your password has been created successfully.
You can use your login credentials to access your digital application user accounts now. Post login, you can switch between your user accounts following the steps described in [Switching Between User Accounts](switching-between-user-accounts.md).
