# Microsoft Invest - June 14, 2021: Introducing a new ALI

We have revamped the **Create New Line Item** and **Edit Line Item** screens to further streamline the process for creating and editing augmented line items (ALIs). This involved renaming, reordering, and regrouping various sections and fields. The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons now appear in the header of the screen to maximize page space. A new collapsible sidebar has also been added to make it easier to navigate between sections.

For more information, see [Create an Augmented Line Item](create-an-augmented-line-item-ali.md).
