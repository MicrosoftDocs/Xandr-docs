# Understanding Your Pricing Terms



Charges and fees for common activity on Xandr's
platform can be found in the Billing
section of the UI. This page provides an overview of these common
charges. For a complete list of charges and fees you may incur, see your
contract or contact your Xandr representative.

## Tiered Pricing (applicable to both Buyers and Sellers)

Some pricing rates in your Xandr contract (e.g.,
BASC, SASC, ad serving fee) may be based on the volume of your
transacted activities on the Xandr platform
(media cost, seller revenue, impressions). For these cases, the more you
transact on the Xandr platform, the lower your
pricing rate may be. If your activities meet the contractually agreed
threshold for tiered pricing, you will receive a credit adjustment for
the correct pricing rates on your invoice (for buyers) or seller
activity statement (for sellers). If you receive consolidated invoices
for multiple member accounts, the adjustment will only apply to the
parent member.





## Near-Real Time Tiered Pricing (for clients who opt-in)

For clients who have opted into Near-Real Time Tiered Pricing, the
discounted pricing rates will be applied immediately before or just as
you reach the contracted threshold. This will allow you to apply the
savings of these pricing rates in near-real time:

- (for buyers) directly to your media cost budget (instead of having
  them credited to the Invoice that is generated at the end of the
  month).
- (for sellers) directly to your seller revenue (without waiting for an
  adjustment on your Seller Statement or Invoice).





Note: If there is any discrepancy
between when you actually reached the contracted threshold and when our
system applied the discounted rate, you may see a credit for a pricing
adjustment on your Invoice or additional funds on your Seller Statement
or Invoice.





Contact your Xandr representative if you want to
opt-in for Near-Real Time Tiered Pricing.
