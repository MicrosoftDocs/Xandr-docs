# Activate Nielsen Sales Impact for a Line Item



At $0.55 CPM for served impressions, you can activate Nielsen Catalina
Solutions' (NCS) Sales Impact measurement for your augmented line item.
Sales Impact lets you analyze your line item's performance in
influencing offline purchases among your target audience.


1.  Go to the
    Measurement section.
2.  Enable Sales
    Impact.

    <b>Note:</b> Only impressions with an
    associated user ID will incur a $0.55 CPM. Impressions without an ID
    aren't measurable and thus don't incur a fee.

3.  Designate a Report
    On level for generated sales attribution reports:
    <table class="simpletable choicetable choicetableborder" data-border="1"
    data-frame="hsides" data-rules="rows" data-cellpadding="4"
    data-cellspacing="0" data-summary="">
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead class="thead">
    <tr class="header sthead chhead">
    <th class="stentry choptionhd" scope="col"
    style="text-align: left; vertical-align: bottom;">Option</th>
    <th class="stentry chdeschd" scope="col"
    style="text-align: left; vertical-align: bottom;">Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd strow chrow">
    <th class="stentry choption" style="vertical-align: top"
    scope="row">Line Item Level</th>
    <td class="stentry chdesc" style="vertical-align: top">Generates sales
    attribution reports showing data for your line item</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even strow chrow">
    <th class="stentry choption" style="vertical-align: top"
    scope="row">Split Level</th>
    <td class="stentry chdesc" style="vertical-align: top">Generates sales
    attribution reports showing data for your line item's splits</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
4.  Search for and select a
    Product Group.
    

    **Product Group** searches are used to narrow down what
    Category,
    Brand, or
    Product you want to measure
    your Sales Impact performance against.
    Product High is synonymous with a
    product line (**example**: Coca-Cola beverages), and
    Product Low is synonymous with a
    product line's specific product (**example**: Diet Coke or Diet
    Cherry Coke).

    

    <b>Tip:</b> If you want to measure a
    Category as a whole, select
    the row in which only the
    Category is displayed. If you
    want to measure a Brand,
    select the row in which only the
    Brand is displayed. Follow the
    same pattern for a Product
    High and Product Low.

    

    
5.  Select a Report
    Request Frequency option:
    

    Report Request Frequency
    determines when you'll start receiving Sales Impact data reports for
    your line item and how often new reports will be made. Data shown in
    the reports is based on your Report
    On selection in **Step 4**.

    

    - Weekly: You'll receive a weekly
      data report on Tuesdays until the line item is completed.
    - Once Per Flight: You'll receive
      a data report at the end of each flight.
6.  Select a Report
    Range option:
    

    Report Range determines how much
    line item data is shown in each generated report (based on your
    **Step 6** selection). Data shown in the reports is based on your
    Report On selection in **Step 4**.

    

    - Lifetime: Reports will show
      cumulative data starting from a flight's start date and ending two
      days before a report's request date. (Request dates are always on
      Tuesdays.) For example, a report requested (generated) every
      Tuesday would show Sunday as the end date for its reported data.
      

      <b>Tip:</b> Choose this option if you
      want to analyze your line item's cumulative performance in every
      report.

      
    - Seven Days: Reports will show
      data from a seven-day time span that ends two days before a
      report's request date. (Request dates are always on Tuesdays.) For
      example, a report generated every Tuesday would show Sunday as the
      end date for its reported data.
      

      <b>Tip:</b> Choose this option if you
      want to analyze how your line item's Sales Impact performance is
      changing from week to week.
