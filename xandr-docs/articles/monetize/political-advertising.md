# Political Advertising



Xandr permits political advertising (advertising
relating to elections, ballot initiatives, or political candidates) in
the United States, but requires that such advertising comply with
applicable law. As required by law, you must certify certain information
about the ads and the political organization that purchased them for all
political advertising on the state or local level, and for political
advertising on the federal level in Washington
State.

You are not required to certify political advertising serving outside
the United States, but you must still adhere to our <a
href="https://wiki.xandr.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=policies&amp;title=Policies+for+Selling"
class="xref" target="_blank">Policies for Selling</a> (login required)
and comply with all applicable legal and/or regulatory requirements in
the jurisdiction where you are advertising.

Unless specifically authorized by Xandr,
sellers are prohibited from serving ads related
to any federal elections in Canada.

Enable Political Advertising

For the most part, political advertisements are set up in the same way
as other advertisements, using the same
<a href="basic-buy-side-setup-procedures.html" class="xref">Basic
Buy-side Setup Procedures</a>. However, you must take a few additional
steps:

1.  Declare that the advertiser is going to run political advertising.
    For more details, see
    <a href="create-an-advertiser.html" class="xref">Create an
    Advertiser</a>.

2.  If your local or state political ads could or will serve in
    California, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey,
    New York, Virginia, or Washington, or your federal political
    ads could or will serve in Washington State,
    fill out the Political Advertising
    section on the relevant insertion orders. If your political ad will
    not be served in any of those states, you may enter "N/A‚Äù.

    1.  Add the contact information for the person or team in your own
        organization who can best answer any questions about political
        advertising on this insertion order.
    2.  Add details about the political organization that is advertising
        on a state or local level, or on a federal level in
        Washington State. The details include
        contact information, payment method, and the name of the
        candidate or ballot initiative being supported or opposed.
    3.  If the political organization purchasing the ads is an
        independent expenditure committee advertising in
        New York or New Jersey, upload the
        appropriate state registration form.
    4.  Certify that all information provided is accurate and up to
        date, and acknowledge that Xandr is
        relying on the accuracy of the information you provide.

    For more details, see

    class="xref">Political Advertising</a> in
    <a href="create-an-insertion-order.html" class="xref">Create an
    Insertion Order</a>.

3.  Ensure that political creatives include a disclaimer stating who
    paid for the advertisement and whether it was authorized by the
    relevant candidate or paid for by an independent expenditure
    committee.

When a Political Creative Is Not Allowed to Serve

The creative will not be allowed to serve if:

- You have declared that an insertion order contains political
  advertising that could or will serve in a state with public reporting
  requirements, but you have not disclosed the required political
  information on the insertion order, certified that the information you
  provided on the advertiser or the insertion is true, or uploaded a
  registration form for the states that require it.
- An audit detects that a creative is political, but the required
  political information has not been disclosed to
  Xandr.

If the buyer's creative is blocked from serving
by a creative audit, the buyer will be emailed a
notification that the creative does not comply with
Xandr's policies and has been blocked until all
issues are resolved. Generally, all this requires is that
the buyer include the proper disclosures and
information at the Advertiser and Insertion Order level.

Political Reporting Transparency Requirements

To comply with the public reporting required by law in certain states,
Xandr retains certain data about the U.S.
political advertisements that are served using our technology. This
reporting is updated daily, and is stored for four years.

Currently, the states with public reporting requirements for state or
local political advertising are California, Illinois,
Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Virginia, and Washington.

Washington State also has a public reporting
requirement for political advertising for federal elections or
candidates.
