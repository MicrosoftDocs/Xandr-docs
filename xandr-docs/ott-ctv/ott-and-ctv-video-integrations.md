# OTT and CTV Video Integrations

<div class="body refbody">

<div class="section">

<span class="ph">Xandr</span> supports integrations with various OTT
hardware platforms, including CTV, to enable client-side ad insertion
through tags or client-side SDKs. Currently, AppleTV is the only
platform that is supported with an SDK.

Additional OTT-capable device SDKs are in development. If you're
interested in developing an integration for a different platform,
contact your <span class="ph">Xandr</span> representative about beta
programs for these upcoming integrations.
