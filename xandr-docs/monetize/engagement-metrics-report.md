> [!NOTE]

| Column | Description |
|--|--|
| Imps | The total number of impressions served. |
| Measurable Imps | The total number of impressions that were measured for viewability. |
| Viewed Imps | The number of measured impressions that were viewable according to the IAB Viewability definition, which states that an impression is viewable if 50% of the pixels are in view for 1 continuous second. |
| Viewability Measurement Rate | The percentage of impressions measured for viewability out of the total number of impressions. (View Measured Imps / Imps). |
| Viewability Rate | The percentage of impressions that were viewable out of the total number of impressions measured for viewability. (Viewed Imps / View Measured Imps). |
| In-View Duration | The average in-view duration (in seconds) measured for which impressions met the IAB Viewability definition. |
| Not Measured Imps (unsupported cross-domain iframe) | The number of impressions not measured because the creative cannot be measured because the ad was served in a cross-domain iframe and the browser was not supported. All modern browsers are supported but certain old versions may not be supported. |
| Not Measured Imps (creative not found) | The number of impressions not measured because the creative could not be found by the viewability script on the page. For example, this could occur if the div is being replaced or the creative isn't located within five seconds. |
| Not Measured Imps (script not initialized) | The number of impressions not measured because the measurement script did not initialize. This could occur for very short sessions when a user leaves a page before the other component (like the OS in mobile apps) can provide feedback on viewability. |
| Not Measured Imps (no script callback) | The number of impressions not measured because no callback was received from the measurement script. For example, this could occur if the script hasn't executed. |
| Not Measured Imps (unsupported in-app SDK) | The number of impressions not measured because the in-app SDK for the specific inventory is not supported. Please visit the Viewability FAQ to learn about supported in-app SDKs. |
| Not Measured Imps (unsupported native integration) | The number of impressions not measured because the specific type of native inventory is not supported. Please visit the Viewability FAQ to learn about supported native supply. |
| Not Measured Imps (unsupported media type) | The number of impressions not measured because the media type is not supported. Please visit the Viewability FAQ to learn about supported media types. |
| Not measured imps (unsupported supply type) | The number of impressions not measured because the supply type is not supported. Please visit the Viewability FAQ to learn about supported supply types. |
| Not Measured Imps (unsupported impression type) | The number of impressions not measured because the imp type is not supported. Please visit the Viewability FAQ to learn about supported impression types. |
| Not Measured Imps (unknown) | The number of impressions not measured because of an unknown reason. |
| Not Viewed Imps (creative not loaded) | The number of impressions not viewed because the creative did not load before the web page was closed. For example, when a user leaves the web page within one second of the creative being loaded. |
| Not Viewed Imps (not visible per SDK) | The number of impressions not viewed because in-app SDK responded with not visible signal. For example, the Open Measurement Software Development Kit (OM SDK) reported the ad as non-viewable. |
| Not Viewed Imps (hidden browser) | The number of impressions not viewed because either the browser was not in focus, or the browser tab was hidden. |
| Not Viewed Imps (creative hidden by CSS/HTML) | The number of impressions not viewed because the creative was explicitly hidden by CSS or HTML on the webpage. For more details, check your ads' recent style changes. |

## To Run your report

Follow these steps to run your report. Refer to **Dimensions** and **Metrics** section above for more information about the definitions of the data fields.

> [!WARNING]
> The more dimensions you group by, the larger the data set that is returned. Larger data sets can take substantially longer to process. Be sure to group using only the dimensions you need.
>
> 1. Select **Reporting** from the **Network** menu.
> 2. Select the relevant report from the list. The Report screen shows the available filters, dimensions, and delivery options for the report. The selections you make here will determine what report data is delivered to you, and how. For an explanation of how grouping and filtering work, see [Dimensions, Metrics, Filtering, and Grouping](dimensions-metrics-filtering-and-grouping.md).
> 3. Select the relevant filters to limit the data displayed to just the information you want. For example, rather than running a report that shows impressions for all inventory sources, you may want to list results for just a select few. When you select a filter (by clicking Edit), a selection panel appears. Select items in the **Available** list (left), then click Add to include them in the **Chosen** list (right).
> 4. Group by Dimension. Grouping allows you to display rows of data in the order you prefer.
> 5. Choose a delivery option. Once you've selected your filters and grouped by your chosen dimensions, you need to choose a delivery method. Available delivery methods include:
>
>     - **Run now, show results in screen**: For smaller amounts of data, you may want to view the report as soon as possible in your browser.
>     - **Run in background, notify me when results are ready to view**: A popup notification will let you know when the report is ready to view or download.
>     - **Export, send results via email**: Run the report in the background and email the results to one or more email addresses.
>     - **Save as report template**: Save your selected report settings so that you can run this report again in the future. You can name this template using the text entry field under Name this report (its checkbox is auto-selected when you choose this option). A saved report can be rerun from the Your Reports screen.
>     - **Add to scheduled reports**: Run this report automatically at specified times and have it sent to one or more email addresses.
>     - **Name this report**: Give this report with its current settings a name for future reference.
>
