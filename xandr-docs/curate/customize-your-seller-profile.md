# Microsoft Curate - Customize your seller profile

On the **Partner Center** screen, you can edit the profile information that displays to buyers on your **Partner Details** page.

## Step 1. Get started

Go to the **Partner Center** screen (**Partners** > **Partner Center**), select the **Buyers** tab, and click the **My Profile** button to open the **My Seller Profile** dialog. Basic information about your member displays:

- **ID** - The unique identification number for your member.
- **Name** - Your member name.
- **Partner Type** - The type of member you are within Curate:
  - **Buyer** - A member that buys inventory through Microsoft Curate.
  - **Seller** - A member that sells inventory through Microsoft Curate.

Networks viewing this information can toggle between the buyer and seller view.

## Step 2. Update your profile

Complete the following fields:

- **Contact Name** - Enter the name of the primary contact.
- **Contact Title** - Enter the business title of the primary contact.
- **Phone** - Enter the primary contact's phone number.
- **Email** - Enter the primary contact's email address. A notification is sent to this address when the buyer posts a new message in the **Activity Stream**.
- **Website** - Enter the URL of your company's web site.
- **Address/Address 2** - Enter the mailing address for the primary contact.
- **City** - Enter the city in which the primary contact is located.
- **Region** - Enter the state or province in which the primary contact is located.
- **Postal Code** - Enter the postal (zip) code in which the primary contact is located.
- **Country** - Enter the country in which the primary contact is located.
- **Company Info** - Enter any additional information about your company that may be relevant.
- **Use the same information for my buyer profile** - Select this checkbox to use this same information when a seller is viewing your buyer profile in the **Partner Center** screen.
- **Inventory Trust chart** - View an overview of the audit quality of your inventory. You can see the number of impressions as well as the percentage of your inventory that has been self-audited (**Seller-reviewed**) or audited by Microsoft Advertising (**Platform-reviewed**). The statistics for **All** inventory will include your audited and unaudited inventory.

## Step 3. Record your changes

When all changes have been made, click **Save** at the bottom of the dialog. Your changes are saved and you are returned to the **Partner Center** screen.
