# Add a User Group



If you have administrative permissions, you can add user groups to
determine permissions for a set of users.

1.  On the Admin Tools menu,
    click Permissions. The Permissions
    page appears. This displays the Groups panel with a table of all
    existing user groups.
2.  Above the list of groups, click Add
    Group. The Group: New Group panel appears.
3.  In Group Summary section, in
    the Name field, type a name to
    identify the group (e.g., `AdOps`), and optionally, in
    the Description field, type an
    explanation for the group
    (i.e., `Permissions for the Ad Operations team`).
4.  In the Users in This
    Group section, select the usernames you want to add to the
    group, or click Select All to add all available users. As you select
    users on the left, they're added to the list of users on the right.
5.  In the Features Available In This
    Group section, clear the check boxes for the features this
    group shouldn't be able to access. Select the check boxes for the
    features this group should be able to access.  
    The features are broken up into the following
    sets: Capacity, Availability, Products, Orders, Proposals, Pricing, Reports, Scenario, Admin
    Tools, and Other.  
    All features are selected by default.
6.  Click Save.
