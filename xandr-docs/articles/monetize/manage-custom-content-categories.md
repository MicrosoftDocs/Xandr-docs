# Manage Custom Content Categories



Custom content categories allow you to apply a single label to a number
of placement groups and/or placements. Buyers can then more easily
research and buy your inventory. This area of Xandr
Monetize displays a working list of your custom content
categories, allowing you to create buckets in which you can group your
inventory. After you have created custom categories, publishers can
assign placements to them. At that point, b uyers can then choose these
categories when defining the targeting settings of a campaign.

In the Content Categories area of Xandr
Monetize, you can perform the following tasks:

- Create a new custom content category
- Edit the name and description of an existing custom content category
- Delete a custom content category

You can also create a custom content category when managing a placement.
