# Pass Custom Macros to a Split



The split custom macro is used to pass any value to a creative landing
page URL where the split will serve.





<b>Note:</b> Split custom macros are not
supported by Guaranteed Delivery ALIs.



For example, suppose you set a custom macro for a split by defining the
key as "color" and the value as "red". If you have a macro called
`${color}` within the creative's landing page URL,
Xandr will replace it with a "red" value. Before
you begin passing custom macros, you need to first add custom macro keys
to your creatives' landing page URLs when editing a creative or line
item.
