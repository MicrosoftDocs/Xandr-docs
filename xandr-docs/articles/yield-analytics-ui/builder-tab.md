## Building a Target Expression Using Attributes

There are two methods of building a target expression:

**Method 1**

This method is recommended if you know exactly what you are looking for,
and your target expression is small. 

- Click Type Attribute. This allows
  you to type directly into the window. Start typing, and a list of the
  available attributes appears. Scroll down the list and select the
  attributes you desire. Select enter, and it automatically goes to the
  next one.

**Method 2**

This method is recommended if you do not know specifically what you are
looking for. You can start by doing a high-level search, and drill down
further until you get the results you are looking for.

- Click Select Attributes. This
  accesses the Select Attributes screen. There are three main windows
  and three search windows.
- The list in the left-hand window is every attribute that you have
  available to you.
- You can limit the attributes by specified criteria.
- There is extensive search capability. The Contains and Search windows
  at the top of the screen allow you to drill down into the search.
- The four options in the search criteria are: Contains, Starts
  with, Ends with, Equals.
- Once the attribute has been identified and selected, the values for
  that attribute are displayed in the middle column of the screen. Then
  you can further drill-down into your search by applying the same
  search functionality to those results.
- If you want to select multiple attributes at once, you can do so by
  holding down the shift key while making your selection.
- There is also a Select All button,
  if you would like to select all the attributes listed in that window.
- The result of the search is displayed in the right-hand window.
- The right-hand window also has include/exclude functionality. You can
  exclude attributes from your final selection.
- When you are satisfied with your selection,
  click Update. You will now see the
  attributes listed on the Builder screen.
- If you would like to delete an attribute, mouse-over the attribute and
  click on the “x” in the upper right-hand corner.
- If you want to add other attributes, select Attributes again, and the
  entire list is displayed again. The previous selections will still be
  displayed in the right-hand column.




## Building a Target Expression for Products

- You can select a product as base targeting and then add additional
  targeting as described in one of the two attribute methods above.
- If you have existing products in the system that you want to look up,
  then click Select Product. This
  accesses the Select Product screen, which displays a list of
  products. 
- You can start your search by Name or Product ID.
- The additional four options in the search criteria
  are: Contains, Starts with, Ends with, Equals.
- There are five checkboxes at the top of the screen: Rate
  Card, Reporting, Seasonal, Custom, Inactive. By default, Rate Card and
  Reporting are selected. These filters are used to narrow down your
  search, especially if you have a lot of products.
- Click Cancel to cancel this entry.
- When you are satisfied with your selection, click
  Update.
