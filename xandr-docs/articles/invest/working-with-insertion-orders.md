# Microsoft Invest - Working with insertion orders

Insertion orders allow you to easily manage collections of line items that may share a common budget, time span, and business terms. Insertion orders are a standard part of the [Object Hierarchy](object-hierarchy.md). An insertion order can contain one or more line items. For example, you may want to set a common budget and billing periods for several line items, but have each line item target a different region or buy different types of media.
