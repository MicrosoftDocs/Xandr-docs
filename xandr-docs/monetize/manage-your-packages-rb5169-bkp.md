# Manage your packages

As a seller, you can use the **Packages** screen to manage all of your packages. You can search your packages, view details about specific packages, edit package settings, create new packages, preview how your packages look to buyers, share your packages with buyers, and more.

## Getting to the packages screen

To reach the **Packages** screen, select **Partners** \> **Packages** in the main navigation.

## Viewing your packages

Your existing packages are listed on the left. To view advanced details about a package, click on the package's name. The following details display for each package.

- **Associated Deals** - The list of deals that were generated from this package.
  - **Buyer** - The name of the buyer with whom you have the deal.
  - **Deal** - The ID of the deal.
  - **Ask Price** - The price, if any, associated with the deal. This is the minimum amount the buyer must bid in order to compete for the deal inventory.
- **Basic Setup** - The package's name and description.
- **Package Contents** - The impressions included in the package.
  - **Inventory** - The inventory included in the package.
  - **Segments** - The segments included in the package.
  - **Sizes** - The creative sizes included in the package.
- **Package Pricing and Visibility** - The package pricing.
  - **Ask Price** - The price, if any, associated with the package. This is the minimum amount the buyer must bid in order to compete for the packaged inventory.
  - **Specific Buyer Settings** - Customized settings for specific buyers, if any. You can create a package that is only available to selected buyers and enter custom pricing per buyer.
- **Status** - The status of the package.
  - **Published** - The package is visible to buyers. Buyers can create deals from the package and target those deals.
  - **Unpublished** - The package is not visible to buyers. Campaigns targeting associated deals continue to run unfettered.
  - **Inactive** - The package is not visible to buyers. Campaigns targeting associated deals are prevented from bidding.

## Searching for packages

You can use the search field to find all packages whose names or IDs include a specific string of characters or numbers.

You can also filter your list down to only **Active** or **Inactive** packages; note that active packages include both Published and Unpublished packages.

## Creating a package

To create a new package, click the **+ Create New** button. For step-by-step instructions, see [Create a Package](create-a-package.md).

## Editing a package

To update a package, select the package in the list on the left and then click **Edit** in the **Package Settings** section. After you have made the necessary updates, click **Save** to save your changes.

> [!WARNING]
> **Impact on Existing Deals**
>
> Changing the **Package Contents** (inventory, segments, or creative sizes) or the **Status** (from **Inactive** to **Published** or **Unpublished**, or from **Published** or **Unpublished** to **Inactive**) will immediately impact all existing deals associated to the package. We recommend using the **Activity Stream** on the [Partnership Details Screen - Seller View](partnership-details-screen-seller-view.md) to communicate with relevant buyers before making these types of changes.

## Previewing how your packages look to buyers

To preview how your packages look to buyers, click the **Preview Packages** button.

This takes you to the **Package Marketplace**. By default, you see what your packages look like to all buyers, but you can search for a specific package, filter by package contents, or even view what your packages look like to a specific buyer.

Once you've finished previewing your packages, click **Back to Packages**.

## Sharing your packages with buyers

Once you're ready to commercialize your packages, you can grab a link and send it to both Monetize buyers and external buyers. For more details, see [Share Your Packages with Buyers](share-your-packages-with-buyers.md).

## Generating deals from a package

Once you've shared your packages with external buyers, you may receive requests to generate deals based on the package. To do so, click **+ New Deal from Package** button, select the external buyer for whom you want to create the deal, and click the **Create Deal** button.

> [!NOTE]
> Buyers can create deals for themselves from the **Package Marketplace** screen (**Partners** \> **Package Marketplace**). For more details, see [Get Deals from Seller Packages](get-deals-from-seller-packages.md).

## Reporting on associated deals

You can initiate a network analytics report for deals associated to your package directly from the **Packages** screen. Check the box for each deal that you want to report on and click the **Show in Reporting** button.

This takes you to the Network Analytics report, where the deals you selected are set as filters. For further information about running the report, see [Network Analytics Report](network-analytics-report.md).
