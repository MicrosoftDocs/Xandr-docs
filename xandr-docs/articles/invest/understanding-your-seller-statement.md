# Microsoft Invest - understanding your seller statement

As a member who sells inventory on Xandr's
platform, you receive a monthly statement indicating the amount of revenue you have earned. This page explains the three types of seller statements. Your contract terms define the type of statement you will receive.

> [!NOTE]
> Your statement is delivered in your default currency. Although all transactions are recorded in US dollars, those dollar amounts are converted to your default currency (at the end of the the activity period reflected in the statement). Xandr uses the Reuters conversion rate at the end of the activity period to prepare your statement. We also account for hedging cost as per your contract. The amounts on your statement are converted by multiplying the US dollar amount by the conversion rate less the hedging cost.

> [!NOTE]
> If you selling activity incurs ad serving charges and/or your contracted terms with Xandr has the Seller Auction Service Charge set as a Fee instead of a Deduction, you will also receive an invoice from Xandr. For details on seller-specific charges that can appear on an invoice, see [Understanding Your Invoice](understanding-your-invoice.md).

## Seller activity statement

This document provides you with seller revenue earned during the prior
month. You can view the supporting data by running the Selling Billing
Report in the UI. Your Seller Activity Statement will be automatically
emailed to the individual within your organization who is responsible
for seller activity. If you have any questions, contact
Xandr Client Finance: [billing@xandr.com](mailto:billing@xandr.com).

Here's an example of what a what a typical seller statement looks like:

## Seller remittance statement

This document lists the amount of revenue due to be paid, along with any adjustments. The total difference between the revenue and adjustments is the amount you will be paid on the referenced payment cycle date. Sellers typically gather revenue information by using the Selling Billing Report.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Payment Cycle** date indicated on the Seller Remittance Statement is the date that Xandr will release the payment from our banking institution, not the date that it is received by the Seller. Remittance statements are available from within the UI when payment is made. If no statement is available when an expected payment is made,please reach out to Xandr Client Finance: [billing@xandr.com](mailto:billing@xandr.com).

1. **Seller Name** - The name and address of the seller.

    activity took place.
1. **Member ID** - The unique ID for the customer member.
1. **Payment Terms** - The time period allowed for

    or debit from a previous statement). This value can also include [Invalid Traffic (IVT)  credits](understanding-invalid-traffic.md).

## Netting statment

> [!NOTE]
> You only receive a Netting Statement if you conduct both buying and selling activity with Xandr, have contractually agreed to netting and notified the Client Finance team to enable netting for your account.

 This monthly document lists the amount of revenue you have earned as a seller as well as your activity as a buyer. Xandr then deducts the amount that you owe as a buyer from the revenue you have earned as a seller to determine the amount you will be paid or that you owe.

To have newly added seats included in your netting calculation, contact
Client Finance: [billing@xandr.com](mailto:billing@xandr.com).

1. **Client Information** - This includes the client name and address.

1. **Payment Terms** - Your seller payment terms followed by your
    invoice (buyer) payment terms, as specified in the Payment Terms section of your Xandr Service Exhibit.
    Standard netting terms are 30 days for buyers to pay
    Xandr and 60 days for Xandr to pay sellers. As a result, your netting statement will offset seller activity with buyer activity (both from the previous month). For example, selling activity for March 2017 will be offset against your February 2017 to April 2017 invoices.

    1. Seller payment terms, in the upper right hand corner of the
        statement - the time period in which
        Xandr must pay the amount due to the
        seller.

    1. Buyer payment terms, in the upper right hand corner of the
        statement - the time period in which you must pay the amount due
        to Xandr.

1. **Seller Revenue Share - Seller Period** - The year and month of the
    activity period. In the example below, the statement includes seller
    activity for March 2017.

1. **Total Seller Revenue** - The amount that
    Xandr owes you for inventory you have sold
    within the seller period.

1. **Buyer Statement - Buyer Period** - The year and month of the
    activity period. In the example below, the statement includes buyer
    activity from February 2017 to April 2017.

    Xandr for your buying activity during a
    specific period (i.e., the difference between the total seller
    revenue and total invoices). Please note that finance fees are not
    included.

    1. **Total Payable to Customer** - If the total seller revenue is
        greater than the total invoice amounts, this field lists the
        amount Xandr will pay you.

    1. **Total Amount Due** - If the total seller revenue is less than
        the total invoice amounts, this field lists the amount you must
