# Audio creatives

You can host audio creatives with Xandr or
traffic them through third-party ad servers, which may be created for
traditional radio, streaming radio (TuneIn), music streaming (Spotify),
and podcasts.

Audio creatives can provide:

- **Higher conversion rates**: Linear audio creatives can't easily be
  skipped, so audio creatives typically lead to higher conversion rates.
  Additionally, with audio creatives, you can broaden your targeted
  audience by including mobile devices as many users use their smart
  phones and tablets to stream music and podcasts.

- **1:1 intentional content**: Audio creatives can easily be
  personalized for each targeted audience, instilling emotion and
  memorability through the use of voice.

  metrics, see the following:
