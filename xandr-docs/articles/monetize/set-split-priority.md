# Set Split Priority



If an impression applies to multiple programmable splits, the impression
is assigned to the split with the lowest priority number.

class="section section context">

For example, if Split A (priority 1) is targeting "domain=cnn.com",
Split B (priority 2) is targeting "city=Boston", and an impression is
available from a user in Boston visiting cnn.com, then the impression
will be assigned to Split A because it has a higher priority (lower
priority number) than Split B.





1.  Go to the Split
    Details grid.
2.  Set a priority number for each of your line
    item's splits.
    

    The same priority number can't be set for multiple splits.
