# Digital Platform API - Seller detected site domain report

> [!NOTE]
> This report was deprecated in 2021.

The Seller Detected Site Domain report is designed to provide visibility into the actual domains that are being sold, and provide a tag or publisher level "health-check". Giving sellers visibility into the actual domains provides deeper insight into the inventory that is coming into their network. The detected domains, however, do not have any impact on the auction itself.

The report is best utilized as an investigation tool. That is, a seller runs the report for specific tags or publishers that they want to dig into further. The seller may know off-hand what they want to investigate; for example, it could be a new publisher that they've signed up. But, it would be very useful to give them an easy way to identify potential problems in tags or publishers.

In addition, sellers mostly cares about the tags or publishers that are giving them the most revenue - there may be a long tail that is not worth the time to investigate. So, a seller runs this report to see their best performing tags or publishers as well as whether a tag or publisher is problematic.

## Time frame

The `report_interval` field in the JSON request can be set to one of the following:

- today

- custom

> [!TIP]
> To run a report for a custom time frame, set the `start_date` and `end_date` fields in your report request. For more details about these fields, see [Report Service](./report-service.md).

**Data retention period**

Data retention period for this report is 7 days.

## Passing domains across IFrames

Serving ads inside of iFrames is preferred by publishers for a number of reasons, to include:

- **Increased Security**: For security reasons, communication between iFrames serving from different domains is prohibited by the browser. This is known as the "Same Origin Policy". For more information, see the W3C's ["Same Origin Policy](https://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/Same_Origin_Policy) page.

- **Page Load Speed**: Page load speed is guaranteed to be unaffected by advertisements inside iFrames because iFrames allow asynchronous loading of both page content and advertisements. This ensures that the user does not have to wait for the rest of the page to load in the event that serving an advertisement happens more slowly than expected.

For these and other reasons, some networks provide their publishers with an iFrame in which to display advertisements. If this iFrame delivers its contents from the network's domain and not the publisher's, it can lead to difficulties in determining the domain on which an impression actually occurred.

For example, a publisher is given a snippet of HTML code to put on their pages that includes an iFrame referencing a network's domain, `best-network.net`:

```
<!-- Publisher's Web Page >
<iframe src="http://best-network.net"> <!-- iFrame Referencing Network Domain >
    <script src="http://cooladexchange.net/tag?id=12345"></script> <!-- Ad Exchange Placement serving on Network Domain >
</iframe>
```

The iFrame is located on the publisher's web page, but it is serving its contents from the network's domain. Because the page and the iFrame are hosted on different domains, the security restrictions of the "Same Origin Policy" apply, and communication between the publisher's page and the network's iFrame is forbidden. Therefore the network is unable to determine the actual domain of the publisher's page. As a result, the network passes along its own domain as the referring URL to the placement.

| `4` | `"35-44"` |
| `5` | `"45-54"` |
| `6` | `"55-64"` |
| `7` | `"65+"` |

## Metrics

## Example

### Create the report request

```
$ cat report-request.json

{
  "report": {
    "report_type": "seller_detected_site_domain",
    "columns": [
      "seller_member_id",
      "seller_member_name",
      "placement_id",
      "publisher_id",
      "publisher_name",
      "imps",
      "detected_site_domain_audit_status",
      "detected_site_domain_audit_status_id",
      "site_name",
      "detected_site_domain",
      "detected_top_domain",
      "auction_site_domain",
      "placement_id",
      "is_blocklisted"
    ],
    "filters": [
      "seller_member_id",
      "detected_site_domain_audit_status"
    ],
    "report_interval": "last_7_days",
    "format": "csv"
  }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the report service

```
$ curl -b cookies -X POST -d @report-request.json "https://api.appnexus.com/report"

{
  "response": {
    
    "report_id": "8d3697d23c87e5bebd44370630162990",
    "status": "OK"
  }
}
```

### Download the report data directly to a file

The most common way to download reporting data involves using the `report_id` in a call the **report-download** service, which returns reporting data directly in the file format you specify. In the `curl` call below, we use the `-o` option to specify that the report be saved in a file named `huge-report.csv`. For more details, see the **Using cURL** section in [API Semantics](./api-semantics.md).

```
$ curl -b cookies -o huge-report.csv "https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=8d3697d23c87e5bebd44370630162990"
```

### Retrieve the report data wrapped in JSON (optional)

You will almost always want to use the method described in *Download the report data directly to a file* above. However, if for some reason you prefer to receive the reporting data wrapped in a JSON response, you may pass the `report_id` to the [Report Service](./report-service.md) directly.

```
$ curl -b cookies "https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=8d3697d23c87e5bebd44370630162990"
```
