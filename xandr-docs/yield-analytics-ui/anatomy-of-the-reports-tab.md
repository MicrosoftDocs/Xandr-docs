# Anatomy of Reports tab

The Reports tab has one view, where you can run reports on metrics to research anything from how a product is delivering, to how salespeople are performing.

## Reports tab

The **Reports** tab is comprised of the following sections:

- **Configuration panel** – Specify the dimension and metrics for the report.
- **Dimension Filters panel** – Specify additional filters for the primary item you're reporting on.
- **Metric Filters panel** – Filters to limit the report and add an additional data set.
- **Report pane** – Displays the report you're generating, and updates in real time when you change filters.
