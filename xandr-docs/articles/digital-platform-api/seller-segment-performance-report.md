# Digital Platform API - Seller segment performance report

The Seller Segment Performance Report provides sellers insights into how their targeted segments are contributing to the overall performance of their line items. The report provides data on all targeted segments (includes and excludes) that contributed towards transacted impressions.This reporting helps sellers in the following ways:

- by providing data on the usage per segment, so they can understand how often they used each segment and thus enable them to bill their data providers and/or advertisers appropriately

- by providing data of performance per segment, so they can analyze which segments are performing well or not well and optimize appropriately

- facilitating data clearing, so that instead of them being responsible for billing their data providers each month, Xandr can do it for them.

## Example

### Create JSON formatted report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` of `"seller_segment_performance"`, as well as the `columns` (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the `"format"` in which the data should be returned (`csv`, `excel`, or `html`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md).

```
$ cat curator_segment_performance

{
    "report": {
        "report_type": "seller_segment_performance",
        "columns": [
            "deal_id",
            "deal_name",
            "segment_id",
            "segment_name",
            "targeting_type",
            "targeted_impressions",
            "targeted_revenue"
        ],
        "report_interval": "today",
        "format": "csv"
    }
}
```

### `POST`the request to the report service

```
$ curl -b cookies -X POST -d @seller_segment_performance 'https://api.appnexus.com/report'

{
    "response": {
        "status": "OK",
        "report_id": "a2c95fcff2d8759e69cec123364f9b32"
    }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service

Make a `GET` call with the Report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=a2c95fcff2d8759e69cec123364f9b32'
{
    "response": {
        "status": "OK",
        "report": {
            "name": null,
            "created_on": "2020-09-04 12:46:08",
            "json_request": "{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"seller_segment_performance\",\"columns\":[\"deal_id\",\"deal_name\",\"segment_id\",\"segment_name\",\"targeting_type\",\"targeted_impressions\",\"targeted_revenue\"],\"report_interval\":\"today\",\"format\":\"csv\",\"grouping\":{\"additional_grouping_sets\":[],\"unselected_implicit_groupings\":[],\"additional_groups_on_bottom\":true},\"timezone\":\"UTC\",\"filters\":[{\"curator_member_id\":\"12025\"}],\"reporting_decimal_type\":\"decimal\",\"use_cache\":true},\"extraction_version\":\"refactored\",\"end_date\":1599264000,\"start_date\":1599177600,\"user_id\":\"123456\"}",
            "url": "report-download?id=a2c95fcff2d8759e69cec123364f9b32"
        },
        "execution_status": "ready"
    }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the Report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and Report ID in the `url` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!TIP]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=a2c95fcff2d8759e69cec123364f9b32' > /tmp/seller_segment_performance.csv
```
