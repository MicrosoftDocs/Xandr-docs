# Understand best practices

Understanding and implementing the best practices laid out on the [API Best Practices](api-best-practices.md) wiki page is crucial to a smoothly operating integration. These will help you:

- Avoid common pitfalls.
- Better handle potential errors.
- Migrate the integration from Client-Testing to Production.
- React to breaking changes better.
- Debug any issues.

The best practices are covered during the additional API training you receive as part of the onboarding process prior to gaining access to the Client-Testing environment.
