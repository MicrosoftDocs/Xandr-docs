# Set up in-article inventory

To set up your **in-article** (formerly known as **outstream**) inventory:

1. Navigate to **Publishers** > **Inventory Manager**. If prompted, select a publisher.
1. Click **Create New** and select **Placement**.
1. In the **Allowed Media** section, select **In-article** under the **Video** section.

If you have [Outstream Video Player Options](outstream-video-player-options.md), you can fine-tune your in-article video player settings to enable **waterfall processing** and improve ad fill rates within your timeout period.

When you select **in-article** as the media type, the **Video Settings** and **Advanced Video Settings** tabs appear. Configure the following settings:

- **Player size**: Enter the default width and height (in pixels) for the player that will be rendered on the page.
- **Duration**: Enter the maximum duration (in seconds) for returned content.
- **Playback method**: Select how the video plays and its audio settings.
- **Skippable**: Select this option if you want to display a **Skip** button. When users click **Skip**, the in-article ad unit closes.
- **VAST version**: Select the video player's **VAST version** from the **Player Vast Version** menu. The default value is **VAST 2.0**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Use the most recent **VAST version** that your player supports. Players support older versions for compatibility.

  The following **VAST versions** are supported:
  - **VAST 2.0**
  - **VAST 3.0**
  - **VAST 4.0**
  - **VAST 4.1**
  - **VAST 4.2**
