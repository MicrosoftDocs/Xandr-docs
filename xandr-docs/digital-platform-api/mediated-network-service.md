# Mediated Network service

> [!NOTE]
> Mediation is only available to Microsoft Monetize Ad Server customers.

Microsoft Monetize Ad Server mediation allows demand from sources not integrated into the Monetize exchange or [Prebid Server Premium](../monetize/prebid-server-premium.md) to compete for publisher inventory. This includes both well-known partners like Google and custom networks. To call each partner for demand, they must first be created as networks [via the Monetize UI](../monetize/mediation-networks.md) or the Mediated Network service outlined below. It is recommended to limit the number of networks in the waterfall to no more than 3 or 4 for each impression. Having more networks can lead to increased ad serving latency and negatively affect user experience. For additional information on mediation, see [Selling Your Inventory through Mediation](../monetize/mediation-selling-your-inventory-through-mediation.md).

Setup is also required in each Networkâ€™s platform, as outlined in [Integrating for Mediation](../monetize/mediation-integrating-for-mediation.md). In addition, [Monetize reports](../monetize/reporting-guide.md) include Mediated Networks as Advertisers and Bids as Line Items (both filters and dimensions).
