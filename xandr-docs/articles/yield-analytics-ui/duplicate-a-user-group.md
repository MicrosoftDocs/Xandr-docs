# Duplicate a user group

If you have administrative permissions, you can duplicate a user group to quickly set up a new group with similar permissions.

1. On the **Admin Tools** menu, **click Permissions**. The Permissions page appears, displaying the Groups panel with a table of all existing user groups.
1. Click the user group you want to duplicate. The Group: \[Group Name\] panel appears, where \[Group Name\] is the name of the group you selected.
1. At the bottom of the page, click **Duplicate**.
1. In the **Group Summary** section, type a name and description for the duplicate group.
1. Add and remove users in the **Users in This Group** section as follows:
    - To add users to the group, in the list of usernames on the left, select each username you want to add (or click **Select All** to add all users). As you select users, they are highlighted in the list on the left and added to the list on the right.
    - To remove users from the group, in the list of usernames on the right, click the X for each username you want to remove (or click **Clear All** to remove all users). As you select to remove users, they are deleted from the list on the right and un-highlighted in the list on the left.
1. Change the permissions for the duplicate group as needed in the **Features Available In This Group** section. Select the check boxes for the features the group should be able to access. Clear the check boxes for the features the group shouldn't be able to access. The features are broken up into the following sets:
Capacity, Availability, Products, Orders, Proposals, Pricing, Reports, Scenario, Admin Tools, and Other.
1. Click **Save**.
