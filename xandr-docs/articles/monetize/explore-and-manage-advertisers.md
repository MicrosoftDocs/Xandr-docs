# Explore and Manage Advertisers





The Advertisers screen is a management
screen that shows you essential metrics about all your advertisers,
provides quick access to each advertiser's details and child objects,
and reporting options.

Managing Advertisers

- To reach the Advertisers screen,
  select
  Advertisers
   \>  Advertisers in
  the menu bar.
- To edit an advertiser, hover over the row for the advertiser you want
  to edit and then click the pencil icon.
- To activate or deactivate an advertiser, check the box for each
  advertiser you want to activate or deactivate and click
  Activate or
  Deactivate.
- To delete an advertiser, check the box next to each advertiser you
  want to delete and click Delete.
  

  Warning: Deleting an advertiser
  deletes all of its child objects as well, including insertion orders,
  line items, campaigns, creatives, conversion pixels, and segments. The
  deletions are permanent and cannot be reverted. Although deleted
  objects continue to be available in reporting, you will no longer have
  visibility into their specific settings (revenue budget for line
  items, cost budget and targeting for campaigns, etc.).

  

Viewing Metrics

The metrics on the Advertisers screen
help you assess the performance and delivery of your advertisers at a
glance. These metrics are faster and more readily accessed than via
standard reporting; whereas reporting requires you to submit a request
and then wait for a response, these stats are cached on a regular basis
and are shown whenever you open the Advertisers screen.

Because these stats are dependent upon reporting data and are synced
after reporting has closed for any given hour, for a small chunk of time
each hour, there may be discrepancies between reporting and the grid
data. For more details, see
<a href="availability-of-reporting-data.html" class="xref">Availability
of Reporting Data</a>.



Tip: To sort your advertisers by any
statistic, click on the relevant column.



Columns

The following stats are shown for each advertiser. Note that the data
always reflects the currently selected stats interval:

- **ID**  
  The unique identifier of advertiser.
- **Imps Delivery (Last 7 days)**  
  Number of impressions for all line items under the advertiser for full
  7 days previous to the current calendar day, i.e., excluding today.
- **Ins Orders**  
  Number of insertion orders under the advertiser.
- **Line Items**  
  Number of line items under the advertiser.
- **Campaigns**  
  Number of campaigns under the advertiser.
- **CTR** (Click-Through-Rate) **(Last 7 days)**  
  Number of clicks divided by total impressions served for all campaigns
  under the advertiser for full 7 days previous to the current calendar
  day, i.e., excluding today.
- **Rev Delivery (Last 7 days)**  
  Money the advertiser has paid or will pay your network for clicks or
  conversions for full 7 days previous to the current calendar day,
  i.e., excluding today. This is based on revenue settings at the line
  item level.
- **Deal Revenue**  
  The total lifetime revenue from deals.
- **Viewability Rate IAB (Last 7 days)**  
  The percentage of impressions that were viewable out of the total
  number of impressions measured for IAB viewability for full 7 days
  previous to the current calendar day, i.e., excluding today.
- **Viewability Rate Custom (Last 7 days)**  
  The percentage of impressions that were viewable out of the total
  number of impressions measured for viewability for full 7 days
  previous to the current calendar day, i.e., excluding today.
