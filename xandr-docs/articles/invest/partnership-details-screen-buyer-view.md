# Partnership Details Screen



On the Partnership details screen you can review and manage your
relationship with a specific seller. You can track overall spend trends,
view your top brands on the seller's inventory, view the seller's top
publishers from whom you have purchased inventory, view active and
pending deals, and communicate with the seller to negotiate a deal.

Getting to the Partnership Details Screen

To reach this screen, select
Inventory
 \>  Partners.

Viewing Seller Contact Info and Description

Click on a seller and click Show
Profile to view profile information the seller has provided,
including the main contact's name, phone number, email address, and a
description of their business. You can contact the seller directly by
sending a message within the **Activity Stream**. For more information
about the **Activity Stream**, see <a
href="partnership-details-screen-buyer-view.md#ID-00000c3a__ID-00000c8c"
class="xref">Communicating with the Seller</a>.



<b>Important:</b>

If the seller has not entered their contact's name, phone number, email
address, or a description of their business, then this information will
not be available.



Viewing Your Performance on the Seller's Inventory

Click on a seller to view statistics about how your ad campaigns are
performing on the seller's inventory. These statistics update every 24
hours.



<b>Note:</b> If you have not purchased any
inventory from the seller, there will be no information to display in
the dashboard.



Spend

A graph displays spend from all transactions between you and the seller
within the last 30 days. You can use this graph to monitor your activity
on the seller's inventory. If you are targeting an active deal, this
graph can help give you insight into the deal's effectiveness. Since the
spend displayed here reflects all transactions, this graph will not help
you keep track of the spend from a specific deal.

There is a data point for every day. Hover over a data point to see the
date it represents and the spend amount for that day.

Spend by Top Publishers

A table lists the seller's top publishers from whom you have purchased
inventory, listed in order from most to least spend. This information
tells you which of the seller's publishers you are performing best on.

Communicating with the Seller

In the **Activity Stream**, the
Messages tab shows messages between
you and the seller along with the number of days since the message was
posted. You can use the **Activity Stream** to introduce yourself to a
new seller, request changes to your eligibility, allowed payment types,
and targeting access, or discuss why your targeting access isn't working
for you.

In this section you can:

- **Send a message:** Send the seller a message by typing into the field
  at the top of the section, and then clicking
  Post. When you post a new message,
  the system sends a notification to the contact in the seller's
  profile.
- **View last update information:** Text at the top of the section will
  note when the **Activity Stream** was last updated.
- **Hide Activity Stream:** Click the Hide Activity Stream icon
  ("**\<**") to collapse the section and provide more working space.

Click on the Notifications tab in the
**Activity Stream** to view system messages.

  categories.

and past deals from the seller. Each deal displays with additional
details, see
<a href="manage-your-deals-with-sellers.md" class="xref">Manage Your
Deals with Sellers</a> for more information.

Edit a Deal

If you would like to make changes to a deal, send the seller a message
to discuss your needs (see <a
href="partnership-details-screen-buyer-view.md#ID-00000c3a__ID-00000c8c"
class="xref">Communicating with the Seller</a>). The seller can then
edit the deal.

Reporting on Deals

You can run a report to see how your deals are performing. See
<a href="buy-side-reporting-on-deals.md" class="xref">Buy-Side
Reporting on Deals</a> for more information.

Viewing Packages

Packages display the number of
packages available to you. Sellers package their inventory to provide
special access to their premium inventory, discounted rates, or other
opportunities. Click the number under
Packages to review each package's
description, price, and sizes in the Package
Marketplace to determine if you are interested. Then, add the
packages you are interested in to your cart to generate deals. For more
information on generating a deal from a package, see
<a href="get-deals-from-seller-packages.md" class="xref">Get Deals
from Seller Packages</a>.

Requesting a Custom Deal

If you see a package in the Package
Marketplace that interests you but needs some modification, you
can send the seller a message with your request. Click
Request a Custom Deal, explain your
need, and then click Submit to post
your message in the Activity Stream on
the Partner Details page
(Inventory
\> Partners). Use the
Activity Stream to continue your
negotiation with the seller. If the seller agrees to the change you
requested, you will need to generate a deal from a package (see below).
The seller will then modify your deal to meet your needs.

Generating a Deal from a Package

If you are interested in the packaged inventory, you can generate deals
between you and the seller. Click Add to
Cart near the desired packages, then click
Get Deals to create deals that you can
target. For step-by-step instructions, see
<a href="get-deals-from-seller-packages.md" class="xref">Get Deals
from Seller Packages</a>.

Targeting a Deal from the Packages Tab

If you generated a deal from a package, your deal ID is displayed in the
Selected Packages section, see
<a href="get-deals-from-seller-packages.md" class="xref">Get Deals
from Seller Packages</a> for more information. You can
target deals using line item deal targeting. For more information, see
<a href="deal-targeting-ali.md" class="xref">Deal Targeting (ALI)</a>.
