# Manage Your Username and Password



This page explains how to manage your username and password in
Microsoft Invest. It covers the following issues:

- Logging in after being locked out because of multiple failed login
  attempts.
- Retrieving your username if you've forgotten it.
- Resetting your password if you've forgotten it or if it's expired and
  you need a new one.

Logging in after Being Locked Out

If you've entered the incorrect username or password three times, you
will be locked out from Invest DSP. The lockout
will last for a period of **five minutes**. You can attempt to log in
again after waiting five minutes.

Retrieving Your Username

If you cannot sign in to Microsoft Invest due to a
forgotten username, follow these steps:

1.  Go to the login page of Microsoft Invest and
    click Reset Password.

2.  On the Reset Password screen,
    click Forgot Username?

3.  Enter your email address and click Send
    Email.

    Within a few minutes, you'll receive an email including all of the
    usernames associated with the email address you entered. Each
    username is listed with its status so that you can more easily
    identify your current username.

    If you don't see the email in your inbox, be sure to check your spam
    folder. If you still don't see it, the email address you entered
    might not be valid. Try again and submit a support request at
