# Find an Order Line



You can search for a specific order line, or search all order lines to
find at-risk line items that you can then optimize. 

1.  On the Orders tab, in the Orders
    Tasks panel, click Find Order
    Lines. A list of all of the current month's order lines
    appears. These are filtered by default to show all line items except
    those that have been cancelled.
2.  (Optional) On the Filter panel, specify any filter criteria:
    - To filter the orders list by date:
      Click This Month in the Date
      Range filter. Specify a standard or custom time period.
      Click Update.
    - To filter the order list by status:
      Click Includes x Values in
      the Status filter. Click on a status to select or deselect it.
      Click Update. 
    - To filter the list on the type of contract (e.g., sponsorship or
      bulk): Click None Selected in
      the Contract Type filter. Click on one or more contract types to
      select them. Click Update.
    - To filter the list on the inventory (e.g., guaranteed):
      Click None Selected in
      the Inventory Class filter. Click on one or more types of
      inventory to select them.
      Click Update.
3.  In the search box in the toolbar above the order list, type a search
    term. Change the search options as needed, and then press
    Enter. The order list is
    redisplayed to show only the orders that match your search
    criteria.  
    - By default, the search returns orders that contain the search term
      you entered. To change the type of search, on the drop-down list
      to the left of the search box,
      click Contains and select a
      different option (e.g., to search for orders that starts with the
      search term you typed, select Starts
      With).
    - By default, the search is run against the advertiser, order name,
      order ID, order line, and order line ID. To narrow the search to
      just one of these, click All in
      the drop-down list to the right of the search box and select a
      different option (e.g., to search for orders by order name only,
      select Order).
4.  To drill into the high-level details of an order line
    (Status, Salesperson, what it was Sold As, and the Target
    Expression), click to the left of the order line name. 



<b>Tip:</b> From within the order line search
results, you can:

- View the details of an order line – Click a order line's name in the
  Order Line column to open the
  Order Line Visibility page.
