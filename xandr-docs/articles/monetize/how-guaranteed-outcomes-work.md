# How Guaranteed Outcomes Work



The following overview describes the logic of Guaranteed Outcomes:

- Guaranteed Outcomes are possible because the
  Xandr Exchange automatically translates
  outcome-based bids (vCPM & CPCV) from the buyer into impression-based
  CPM revenue for the seller. This translation facilitates the
  transaction by bridging the currency gap between buyer and seller.
- Buyers who choose to buy with Guaranteed Outcomes enter an
  outcome-based bid (e.g. vCPM for Views and CPCV for Completes) as
  opposed to an impression-based CPM bid. Their bid will be converted
  and enter the seller's auction as an impression-based CPM bid, with
  normal auction mechanics applied.
- If the bid wins the auction, the seller is paid the impression-based
  CPM price. The buyer's creative is served, and the buyer is only
  charged if the desired outcome is measured on the impression.
- By default, Xandr uses the IAB definition of a
  viewable ad (50% of pixels in-view for 1 continuous second) and the
  Xandr measurement script to determine a view.
  However, we support additional viewability definitions and measurement
  technology vendors as well. See
  <a href="introduction-to-viewability.md" class="xref">Introduction to
  Viewability</a> for more information about choosing these alternate
  measurements.
- For Guaranteed Completes, we always define a complete as a served
  video ad that reaches 100% of its duration.
