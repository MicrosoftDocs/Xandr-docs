# Change Your Default Home Page



You can change the page that loads by default when you log in to yield
analytics:

1.  In the top right corner of any page, click your name, and then
    click Preferences. The Preferences
    page loads.
2.  In the Set Defaults panel, in the Home
    Page field, click the link for the current setting
    (e.g., Availability). Select a different page from the drop-down
    list that appears.
3.  Click Save Defaults. The page you
    chose is displayed, and loads by default the next time you log in to
    the system.
