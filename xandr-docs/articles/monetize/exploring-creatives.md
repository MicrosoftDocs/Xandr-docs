# Exploring Creatives



You can work with creatives from the Creative
Manager screen. From there you can view the creatives that are
associated to a particular advertiser as well as add and update
creatives.



The Creative Manager screen shows all
the creatives associated with the selected advertiser. For each
creative, the following information is displayed:

- **Name**: The name of the creative that was provided on the
  Create New screen.
- **ID**: Unique identifier assigned to the creative.
- **Status**: Displays standard creative checks like click test,
  rendering, etc.
- **Preview**: Allows a user to see what the creative looks like. The
  user can also copy a preview link to easily share the creative
  preview.
- **Type**: Creative type such as video, native, audio, and banner.
- **Creative Properties**: The property of the creative. For example:
  HTML5, Expandable, Interstitial, High Impact, etc.
- **Creative Audit**: The audit status of the creative, which may be
  Platform, No Audit, and Self-Audited.
- **Impressions**: Total number of impressions delivered. For video ads,
  an impression is delivered when the first frame of the video is
  loaded.
- **Clicks**: Total number of clicks.
- **CTR%**: Ratio of clicks to impressions (clicks/impressions x 100),
  expressed as a percentage.
- **VCR%**: Ratio of video completions to impressions (video
  completions/total impressions x 100), expressed as a percentage.
- **Viewability Rate%**: The percentage of impressions that were
  viewable out of the total number of impressions measured for
  viewability (viewed impressions/view-measured impressions x 100). If
  the viewability threshold is targeted, the viewability rate is
  compared to the predicted threshold that is calculated by dividing
  total views by total impressions.
- **Conversions**: Total number of post-view and post-click conversions.
- **Conversion Rate%**: Ratio of conversions to impressions
  (conversions/impressions x 100), expressed as a percentage.
- **Tracking**: When adding creatives, you can set a variety of tracking
  parameters from the **Pixels (optional)** section, such as frequency
  and recency caps, third-party tracking pixels, and segment pixels. For
