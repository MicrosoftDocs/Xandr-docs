# Use User Test Groups with a Split



You can perform A/B testing with user test groups, which target distinct
groups of users per split.





<div id="target-user-test-groups-with-a-split__steps_qc1_vgm_hmb"

1.  Select the Use User
    Test Groups checkbox.
    

    In the User Test Group column
    that appears, line item traffic is evenly distributed to the
    existing splits (excluding the Line Item Default split).

    
2.  To modify a percentage, enter a new value in
    the Percent field.
    

    Alternatively, you can modify the percentage from the
    Edit
    Split \> Setup tab
    by entering a new value in the % for this
    split field.
    

    Note: When the Line Item Default
    split is set to active or has a budget allocation greater than 0%,
    the line item default will always include the remaining pool of
    users not targeted by the other splits. Also, the Line Item Default
    split will always include cookieless users.
    If you don't want to serve cookieless users:

    - **If you're using spend allocation**: Set the Line Item Default
      allocation to 0%.
    - **If you're not using spend allocation:** Set the Line Item
      Default split to inactive.
