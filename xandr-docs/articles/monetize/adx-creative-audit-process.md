# Google Ad Manager Creative Audit Process



For your creative to serve on Google Ad Manager inventory, it must pass
both the Xandr and Google Ad Manager creative
audit.



If you are eligible to buy Google Ad Manager inventory, your creatives
are automatically enrolled in the Google Ad Manager audit process. Once
you add a new creative, Xandr automatically
submits it to Google Ad Manager. The Xandr and
Google Ad Manager audit processes begin simultaneously. Your creatives
do not need to pass the Xandr audit in order to
be submitted to Google Ad Manager. The Google Ad Manager audit process
runs hourly, which is independent of the Xandr
audit. Xandr cannot make any guarantees about
how quickly the audit will be performed by Google Ad Manager. We are
only able to control how often we check Google Ad Manager for an audit
status. There are four possible Google Ad Manager creative audit
statuses:

- **No Audit** - The creative has not been submitted to Google Ad
  Manager for audit. This status is displayed immediately after your
  creative has been saved, but will eventualy change to "Pending" once
  we have submitted the creative to Google Ad Manager. This can also
  happen if you are not eligible to buy Google Ad Manager inventory.
- **Pending** - The creative has been submitted to Google Ad Manager for
  audit, but the audit has not been completed yet. Therefore, it is not
  yet eligible to serve on Google Ad Manager inventory.
- **Approved** - The creative has been approved by Google Ad Manager. If
  the creative has also passed the Xandr audit,
  it will be eligible to serve on Google Ad Manager inventory.
- **Rejected** - The creative has been rejected by Google Ad Manager and
  is not eligible to serve on Google Ad Manager inventory. This status
  will be accompanied by an explanation from Google Ad Manager.





You should also note the following:

- Xandr does not audit creatives for compliance
  with Google's policies. Xandr only audits
  creatives to ensure that they adhere to our
  <a href="creative-standards.md" class="xref"
  title="Xandr has foundational policies that all creative and inventory content must follow. Creatives that violate these policies will be removed from the platform, and will be ineligible for both real-time bidding (RTB) and in-network buying. Repeated violation of these policies may result in strikes against offending members.">Creative
  Standards</a>. For more information about Google Ad Manager's
  standards, see <a
  href="https://support.google.com/authorizedbuyers/answer/1325008?hl=en"
  class="xref" target="_blank">Google's Ad Exchange Policies</a>.
- Audit email notifications do not include the
  Google Audit column.





<b>Warning:</b> **Appeals for Google Ad
Manager audit failures must go through Google Ad Manager**. Our audit
team is not able to assist clients with appeals if a creative is
rejected by Google Ad Manager because we are simply reflecting the audit
status that Google's API has returned.

In the event that you want to appeal, you should update the creative
content and then resubmit your creative for audit. This will trigger a
full re-audit cycle with our auditors and Google Ad Manager.
Alternatively, you can reach out to your contacts at Google Ad Manager
so that your appeal can be considered and manually resubmitted.
