# Updating my settings

You can update your contact information, password, set email preferences, customize the language, locale, and time zone used for the portal. Go to **Profile** > **My Settings**, and select the appropriate options from the drop-down menus.

## Receive email notifications

The **Receive email notifications** checkbox enables email notifications for various features that are not currently enabled. It has no effect on whether you receive comments for your cases or your cc cases, which will always occur.

Although a number of settings are visible, these features are not currently in use.
