# Microsoft Monetize - Buying video inventory

This page provides you with a suggested workflow to optimize the new enhancements around our buy-side video offering.

## Step 1. Add VAST video creatives

You can either opt to have Microsoft Advertising host your VAST creatives, or add creatives hosted by a third-party provider. For more information, see [Add a Creative](add-a-creative.md) and [Add Creatives in Bulk](add-creatives-in-bulk.md).

> [!NOTE]
> A contract addendum must be signed prior to hosting with Microsoft Advertising. Contact your Microsoft Advertising representative for more information.

## Step 2. Create your buy-side setup

Create your ad campaign by following the [Basic Buy-side Setup Procedures](basic-buy-side-setup-procedures.md).

## Step 3a. Target inventory

Target your own managed video inventory or third-party inventory. (See [Third-Party Inventory Targeting](third-party-inventory-targeting.md)).

## Step 3b. Target video (optional)

Set video targeting parameters to target specific types of inventory. For more information, see [Video Targeting](video-targeting.md). For Deals targeting, see [Video Player Targeting](video-player-targeting.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Setting any of the video targeting parameters will reduce targeting to the corresponding attributes and will significantly limit your delivery potential.

## Step 4. Generate reports

Run reports to analyze video event metrics and further optimize your video buying approach. For more information, see [Network Video Analytics Report](network-video-analytics-report.md).
