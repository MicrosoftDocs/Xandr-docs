# Set Seller Defaults



On the Partner Center Screen, the
**Default Settings** option allows you to establish default inventory
trust settings for all sellers. It is possible to override these
settings for individual sellers. For details, see
<a href="edit-seller-defaults.html" class="xref">Edit Seller
Defaults</a>.



Note: Inventory trust settings only
apply to standard line item targeting.



Step 1. Get started

Go to the Partner Center screen
(Partners
\> Partner Center) and click on
the Default Settings button to display
the Default Settings dialog.

Step 2. Update your default settings



Important:

**Changes to the Partner Center**

New sellers are eligible (that is, available for buying) by default in
Partner Center, and we have
removed the ability to set default eligibility to **Blocked**. Though
default eligibility options are no longer available, no
Partner Center blocks set before
March 10, 2016 have changed.

AppNexus Direct sellers can only be blocked
using domain or campaign exclusions.





Tip: **Get to Know
AppNexus Direct**

AppNexus Direct is a group of 100+ sellers we
have identified as mostly selling owned and operated inventory or
selling through exclusive relationships with publishers.

For more information, please see
<a href="appnexus-direct-for-buyers.html" class="xref"

Xandr account manager.





Note: **Unblocking
AppNexus Direct Sellers**

Once you unblock an AppNexus Direct seller, you
cannot reinstate blocking for that seller in the
Partner Center.



The **Default Inventory Trust** setting indicates whether you trust
inventory reviewed only by the Xandr platform
(**Platform-reviewed**), by the Xandr platform
and the seller (**Seller-reviewed**), or all inventory (**All**). For
more information on the different inventory trust levels, see the
Setting default inventory trust
section in

Center Screen - Buyer View</a>.
