# Prebid Server Premium Services



Xandr's Prebid Server Premium (PSP) is a self-service, server-side
solution offering control over unified auctions that maximizes revenue
for publishers' inventory. As part of Monetize, users can manage
settings, optimize partners, and review analytics within the Monetize UI
or via our APIs. PSP is supported across channels (web, mobile web,
mobile app, over-the-top) and formats (display, native, video).
