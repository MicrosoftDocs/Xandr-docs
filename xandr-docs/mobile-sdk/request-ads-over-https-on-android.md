<span class="notetitle">Note:</span> This property is scheduled to be
deprecated in a future release.

</div>

Starting with v2.15 of our SDKs, we support requesting ads over HTTPS.

<div class="note">

<span class="notetitle">Note:</span> This is a global setting for the
<span class="ph">AppNexus</span> SDK. You only need to set this once,
and all future ad requests will be sent over HTTPS.
