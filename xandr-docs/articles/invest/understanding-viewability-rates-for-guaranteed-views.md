# Microsoft Invest - understanding viewability rates for guaranteed views

While the buyer is only charged for viewable inventory with Guaranteed
Views, line item reporting will not show a 100% viewable rate. When
buying Guaranteed Views, a buyer's creative is always served to the page
to allow the viewability script to measure the actual viewability. If
the script determines that the creative was not viewable, then the buyer
will not be charged, but the script will still report a measured,
non-viewable impression.

We don't recommend comparing viewability rates between vCPM campaigns
and CPM campaigns. vCPM campaigns, uniquely, incur no media cost for
non-viewable impressions. Instead, you should compare the underlying
cost per view. (In reporting, this information can be found in the
Clearing Event Buyer Media Cost eCPM field.) In other words, how much
did the advertiser have to spend in order to reach the audience? When
the buyer only pays media costs for viewable impressions, inventory with
a lower average viewability may nevertheless result in better
performance per unit spend for the advertiser.
