# Edit a Network User



This page walks you through the steps required to edit a
Network user, including contact information,
peer approval requirements. Only users with the **User Manager** role
can edit a Network User.

Step 1. Select the user

On the Member Users screen
(Network
\>  User Manager \>
 Users or hover over
your member name in the upper-right corner of the menu bar and click
Member Users), click the row of the
user whose permissions you want to change to expose the **User Details**
pane. Then click the pencil (Edit) icon.

This opens the **Edit \[User\]** dialog.

Step 2. Edit user details

In the User Details tab, make any
desired changes to the user's basic information. Review and make any
updates to the user's name and contact information, and the reporting
decimal and numerical format. You can also decide if you want to give
the user the ability to install apps - check the **Admin User** checkbox
if you want to enable this option.

To make the user's experience as intuitive as possible, select the
decimal and number formats that are conventional in the user's
geographical location.



Note: You cannot change a user's login
username. To assign a new username you must create a new user.

You cannot change a user's password unless you are editing the User
Details for yourself. That is, you can change the password only for the
user identity you used to log in.



Step 3. Edit the user's peer approval settings

In the Roles & Permissions tab, make
any desired changes to the user's peer approval settings. In the
Peer Approval Status field, check the
**User must have peer approval to activate campaigns** checkbox if you
want to require approval from another user on the
Network before the new user's campaigns can be
set to Active. If peer approval is required for the user and you would
like to turn it off, uncheck the checkbox to remove this requirement.

The campaign peer approval feature allows you to require a user to get
approval from another user before campaigns can be set to **Active**.
This feature minimizes the risk of user-side errors in campaign
activation and can help users identify and change settings to improve
campaign performance.

For more information about how peer approval works during campaign
creation and activation, see the **Complete peer approval** step in
<a href="create-a-campaign.html" class="xref">Create a Campaign</a>.

Step 4. Edit the user's advertiser or publisher list

For users whose role includes Advertiser or Publisher Manager, you can
also modify the list of advertisers or publishers to which that user
should have access.

Step 5. Save the user

Once you have finished making any changes in both the **User Details**
and Roles & Permissions tabs, click
the Save button to save your changes
and return to the
Network Users
screen.
