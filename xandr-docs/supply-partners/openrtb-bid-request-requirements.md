# OpenRTB bid request requirements

Xandr supply partners must provide sufficient auction metadata on [incoming bid requests](incoming-bid-request-from-ssps.md) to ensure that buyers have the information they need to bid intelligently. This page documents the OpenRTB fields required and the corresponding volume thresholds that need to be met. For example, a 95% threshold for the banner height field indicates that 95% of randomly sampled requests must contain information about the banner height. Traffic samples must meet the thresholds for all relevant fields. Inventory that does not meet the requirements outlined below will be eligible for selling through deals, but will not be made available on the open exchange.

Currently, we determine eligibility for the following formats:

- Web Banner
- Web Video
- Web Audio
- Web Native
- App Banner
- App Video
- App Audio
- App Native

The "web" designation includes both desktop web and mobile web;  "app" is defined as in-app inventory. Additional thresholds may be added in the future for other media types such as native or audio.

## Bid request criteria and thresholds

The sections below outline the OpenRTB bid request fields that are required for each format. The "Required OpenRTB Field" column represents the IAB OpenRTB fields that correspond to the "Auction Attribute" in the first column. In cases where multiple OpenRTB fields are listed for a given auction attribute, only one of those fields is required. For example, in order for a request to pass the "Tag ID" criterion for "Web Banner Criteria", either site.id or imp.tagid needs to be passed.

### Web banner criteria

| Auction Attribute | Required OpenRTB Field | Type | Description | Threshold |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Height | imp.banner.h | integer | Specifies the exact height of the banner in pixels. | 95% |
| Width | imp.banner.w | integer | Specifies the exact width of the banner in pixels. | 95% |
