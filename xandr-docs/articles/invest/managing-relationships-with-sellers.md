# Managing Relationships with Sellers



Buyers use the Partner Center to
foster and manage relationships with specific sellers.

As a buyer, you can use the Partner
Center to:

- Communicate with sellers directly in Invest
  DSP using the Activity Stream
- Leverage more overall spend for targeting access and/or lower
  impression prices
- Track spend on a specific seller's inventory to gain insight into the
  partnership and trends
- <a href="partner-center-screen-buyer-view.md" class="xref">Partner
  Center Screen</a> - View your preferred partners, search all sellers,
  set preferred sellers, and review impression and click statistics for
  each seller.

  relationship with a specific seller by tracking overall spend trends,
  view your top brands on the seller's inventory, view the seller's top
  publishers from whom you have purchased inventory, view seller
  statistics, and send messages directly to the seller in
  Invest DSP.
