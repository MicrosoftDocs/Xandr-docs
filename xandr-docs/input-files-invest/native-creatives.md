# Native Creatives



You can host video, audio, banner, carousel, and app install native
creatives with Xandr.


Since native creatives match the form, feel, and function of the
platform that they appear on, they provide publishers with the ability
to integrate advertising more seamlessly with their inventory. In
contrast with traditional HTML and JavaScript creatives, native
creatives provide flexibility because they can be integrated into
websites and mobile apps using any one of these formats:

- **Video**: Raises awareness through video content that mirrors the
  look and feel of the content of a particular webpage.
- **Audio**: Raises awareness through audio content that mirrors the
  look and feel of the content of a particular webpage.
- **Banner**
  - **Branded Content**: Displays in the same format as full editorial
    content.
  - **Recommendation**: Displays alongside other editorial content,
    creatives, and paid content.
  - **In-Feed**: Serves on higher quality inventory and perform better
    for both advertisers and publishers. Prominent examples of in-feed
    native creatives include Facebook's Promoted Posts and Twitter's
    Promoted Tweets.
- **Carousel**: Combines multiple videos or images into a single ad
  unit.
- **App Install**: Increases installs or prompts re-engagement on mobile
  apps.





Native creatives can also provide:

- **Simplicity**: Advertisers submit native creative assets such as
  titles and images once rather than building new creatives for each
  device size and/or resolution.
- **High performance**: Native creatives have been found to lower CPAs
  for advertisers while increasing revenue for sellers.
- **Control**: With native creatives, publishers can control the user
  experience on their sites.
