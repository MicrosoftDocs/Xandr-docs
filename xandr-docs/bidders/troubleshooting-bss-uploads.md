# Bidders - Troubleshooting BSS uploads

You can use the methods in this topic to diagnose any problems with your segment data upload.

## Different Phases of Batch Segment Service

This section describes the phases of upload, so you can understand where problems may be occurring.

**Starting - Request upload URL and Job ID**

In this phase, the clients request an upload URL and a job ID. This stage times out in 5 minutes. If jobs are stuck in this phase, it indicates that the clients requested the URL but failed to upload anything within the allotted time.

**Uploading**

In this phase, the clients upload the file to the given URL. It is recommended not to exceed one upload per minute. If the clients have more than 200 jobs waiting to be processed at any given time, they will be prohibited from uploading additional jobs.

**Validating and Processing**

Once the clients upload the file, processing of the file occurs in the next phase where the validation of segment IDs and user IDs is carried out. If a record contains invalid segment or user IDs, the platform does not process the record. When the clients check the job status, they will be able to view statistics regarding the number of invalid users.

**Completion**

In this phase, the data of the file is successfully uploaded to the platform, and it is available for targeting.

## Possible upload errors

**Attempting to upload file larger than 0.5GB**

``` 
{"response":{"status":"ERROR","error_code":"FILESIZE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED","errors":["Member
            exceeds maximum byte size allowed for a file"]}}
```

**Error code in batch segment upload job**

``` 
""batch_segment_upload_job": {
      "phase": "error",
      "start_time": "2015-08-13 18:40:32",
      "uploaded_time": null,
      "validated_time": null,
      "completed_time": null,
      "error_code": "uploading-error",
      "time_to_process": "0.00",
      "percent_complete": 0,
      "num_valid": 0,
      "num_invalid_format": 0,
      "num_valid_user": 0,
      "num_invalid_user": 0,
      "num_invalid_segment": 0,
      "num_invalid_timestamp": 0,
      "num_unauth_segment": 0,
      "num_past_expiration": 0,
      "num_inactive_segment": 0,
      "num_other_error": 0,

      "last_modified": "2015-05-13 18:40:33"
    }
```

The following errors may happen when:

1. You have reached one of its four upload limits:

    - daily bytes,
    - hourly bytes,
    - daily lines, or
    - hourly lines

    Attempting to exceed daily byte upload limit

    ``` 
    {"response":{"status":"ERROR","error_code":"RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED","errors":["Member
                      exceeds maximum allowed bytes per day"]}}
    ```

    Attempting to exceed hourly byte upload limit

    ``` 
    {"response":{"status":"ERROR","error_code":"RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED","errors":["Member
                      exceeds maximum allowed bytes per hour"]}}
    ```

    Attempting to exceed daily lines upload limit

    ``` 
    {"response":{"status":"ERROR","error_code":"RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED","errors":["Member
                      exceeds maximum allowed number of lines per day"]}} 
    ```

    Attempting to exceed hourly lines upload limit

    ``` 
    {"response":{"status":"ERROR","error_code":"RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED","errors":["Member
                      exceeds maximum allowed number of lines per hour"]}}
    ```

1. You have canceled the upload.

1. The upload phase exceeds 90 minutes.

    Exceeding maximum time to upload

    ``` 
    {"response":{"status":"ERROR","error_code":"RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED","errors":["Maximum
                      upload time exceeded"]}}
    ```

## Possible processing errors

**Invalid format**

If the value of the `num_invalid_format` field is greater than `"0"`, check the values in the `error_log_lines` field.

In the example below, the `num_invalid_format` field displays a value of `"1"`, with details provided in the `error_log_lines` field.

In the `error_log_lines` field:

- `num_invalid_format` indicates that there was a problem parsing a line in the uploaded file.
- `"failed with an illegal number of fields"` indicates that the number of fields in a `segment_fields` block did not match what was defined in the batch-segment config (for more information, see [Initial BSS Account Setup](initial-bss-account-setup.md)).

In this case, the config expects three fields to be defined in the block: `SEG_ID`, `VALUE`, `EXPIRATION`, but the parser only found two fields - `SEG_ID` and `VALUE`, thus showing an error.

## JSON fields

| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `GET` | `https://api.appnexus.com/batch-segment/meta` | Use this call to find out which fields you can filter and sort by. |

| Fields | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `batch_segment_upload_job` | object | This is an object whose fields contain metadata describing the upload and processing job. If you are using the Impbus API, this will be an array containing a single object. See [Batch Segment Upload Job](#batch-segment-upload-job) for details. |
| `id` | int | This is the ID of the `batch_segment_upload_job` object associated with this request. <br>**Default**: An automatically generated number. |
| `status` | string | The status of the API call; successful calls return `"OK"`. |

### Batch segment upload job

When you request the status of your processing job, the system returns a `batch_segment_upload_job` object (if you are a data provider, this will be an array containing a single object). Depending on which request you're making to the service, it will contain some or all of the following metadata.

> [!NOTE]
> Most metadata will only be present when `"phase": "completed"`.

| Fields | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `completed_time` | date | The time at which file processing was completed. |
