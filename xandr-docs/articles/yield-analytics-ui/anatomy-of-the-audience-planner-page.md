# Anatomy of the Audience Planner Page



The Audience Planner page on
the Products tab shows an analysis of
how products in your network overlap.


## About the Audience Planner Interface

The Audience Planner page is comprised of the following four panels:

- **Configuration** – This panel, on the top left side of the page, is
  where you select the main criteria for your lookup. This includes the
  product or target attribute you want to analyze (i.e., the focus), and
  the metric you want to use for your analysis (overlapping impressions
  or audience index).  
    

- **Filters** – This panel, which appears beneath
  the Configuration panel, is where you can narrow your analysis by time
  period, product group, target attribute, parent product, product type,
  and overlap type.

  <p><strong>Analysis</strong> – This is the main panel on the Audience
  Planner page. It is populated with the products that meet the criteria
  and filters you selected in the Configuration and Filters panels.<br />
  By default, this panel is displayed in a chart view, with each bar in
  the chart representing an overlapping product based on the primary
  metric you selected. To see overlapping impressions and audience index
  values side by side, as well as capacity, availability, sell-through
  rate, and more for each overlapping product, view the analysis in a
  table (referred to as list view) by clicking above
  the Configuration panel. From the list view, you can also check
  availability based on overlapping products.<br />

- **Product** – This panel, which appears when you click a product in
  the Analysis panel, shows high-level information about the product.
  This includes the product type, rate card, status, and targeting
  characteristics. Change the analysis to focus on the selected product
  by clicking Set as Focus. Make the
  selected product the baseline for audience index analysis by
  clicking Set as Baseline. View the
  full details of the selected product by
  clicking Product Visibility.
