**Transparency and Consent Framework**.


## Nielsen DAR and Connected TV (CTV)

Nielsen DAR provides demographic tracking for ads served on connected
devices with Roku, Amazon, Samsung, and Hulu. It also takes into account
"co-viewing," when members of the same household are watching
simultaneously.



<b>Note:</b> Nielsen DAR can only track CTV
ads in the United States.





Here's how Nielsen tracks through CTV partners:

1.  Nielsen sends Nielsen DAR tags to its CTV partners.
2.  CTV partners provide subscriber data to Experian, a consumer
    reporting company.
3.  Experian assigns demographic data to the received subscriber data.
4.  Nielsen calibrates Experian's demographic data.
5.  Nielsen DAR users receive the data on the CTV ads' reached
    audiences.







## Nielsen DAR Use Cases

- Identify the best inventories to target based on how well they attract
  your targeted demography.
- Validate your current demographic data against Nielsen's reliable and
  widely used data.
- Standardize measurements between your traditional TV and digital video
  advertising to better compare their effectiveness.
- Provide more transparency to clients on how you used their advertising
  budget and who their advertising campaigns reached.
