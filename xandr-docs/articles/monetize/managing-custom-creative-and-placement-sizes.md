# Managing Custom Creative and Placement Sizes



You can define custom dimensions and use those sizes when you
<a href="working-with-creatives.html" class="xref"
title="You can traffic a wide range of creative types, from banners to increasingly pervasive rich media types, through the Xandr platform. Only secure content is supported.">Working
with Creatives</a> or
<a href="working-with-placements.html" class="xref">placements</a> to
the system. These size dimensions are applicable in numerous locations
throughout Microsoft Monetize. You can also indicate
whether a size is standard or non-standard, which allows you to
categorize the sizes as needed throughout the user interface.

On the Custom Sizes screen, you
can perform the following tasks:

- Define a new creative/placement size
- Edit existing creative/placement sizes
- Indicate whether a creative/placement size is designated as
  standard or
  non-standard
- Delete a creative/placement size

Procedures

Navigate to the Custom Sizes
screen by selecting
Network 
\>  Tools  \>
 General from the menu bar and
then select the Custom Sizes tab.

Define a New Size

1.  Open the Custom Size Details
    dialog. Select the New Custom Size
    button at the top left of the screen. The
    Custom Size Details dialog
    appears.
2.  Define the width and height of the creative/placement. Enter the
    values (in pixels) in the Width
    and Height fields.
3.  Indicate if these dimensions are a standard size. If these
    dimensions should be considered standard, select the
    Set as standard size check box. If
    this option is checked, this size appears under the
    Standard Sizes header when working
    with creatives and placements. Conversely, if this option is not
    checked, this size appears under the
    Non-Standard Sizes. You should
    designate a size as Standard if it
    is a size that you expect to use often when defining creatives or
    placements, as these are at the top of the list of available sizes.
    The Non-Standard Sizes are those
    which are used less-frequently and are available at the bottom of
    the list.

Edit an Existing Size

1.  Choose the size to be edited. Click any dimension in the list. The
    Custom Size Details dialog appears
    with the Width and
    Height fields already filled out.
2.  Change the width and height. Update one or both of the values (in
    pixels) in the Width and
    Height fields.
3.  Indicate whether these dimensions are a standard size. Change the
    Set as standard size check box as
    desired. If this option is checked, this size appears under the
    Standard Sizes header when working
    with creatives and placements. Conversely, if this option is not
    checked, this size appears under the
    Non-Standard Sizes. You should
    designate a size as Standard if it
    is a size that you expect to use often when defining creatives or
    placements, as these are at the top of the list of available sizes.
    The Non-Standard Sizes are those
    which are used less-frequently, and they are available at the bottom
    of the list.

    the check box to the left of the header
    Size (at the top of the list of
    sizes) to select all sizes.
2.  Click the More Actions Button to
    expose the drop-down list and select the
    Delete option. A dialog appears,
    asking you to confirm the deletion. Select
    Confirm to proceed.

longer available for the creation of new creatives or placements, nor as
a filter in reporting.
