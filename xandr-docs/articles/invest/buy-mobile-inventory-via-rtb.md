# Buy Mobile Inventory via RTB





<b>Note:</b> The descriptions in this topic
apply only to Standard Line Items (not available in Invest). A new
version of this document that is applicable to Invest and Augmented Line
Items will be available at a later date.



This document describes how to set up a campaign to run on third-party
mobile inventory (also known as "RTB" inventory). RTB inventory is made
available for sale by other members of the Xandr
platform; this includes ad networks and major publishers as well as
external partners and exchanges that are integrated with
Xandr.

For answers to frequently asked questions, see the
<a href="mobile-buying-faq.md" class="xref">Mobile Buying FAQ</a>.

Creating a mobile campaign involves defining:

- **Supply Type** - Whether you want to buy mobile app inventory, web
  inventory optimized for mobile devices, or both.

- **Media Budget** - How much you are willing to spend on buying mobile
  media (in dollars or impressions).

- **Buying Strategies** - Buying via RTB means you want to run on in-app
  and/or device-optimized web inventory from other networks on the
  Xandr platform as well as external supply
  sources. For RTB buys, you define exactly how you want to value
  impressions and submit bids.

- **Learn Budget** - How much you are willing to spend on optimizing
  your campaign (in dollars or impressions). Learn budget only applies
  when buying third-party inventory using a strategy involving
  optimization.

- **Targeting** - What specific inventory you want to run on and how
  precisely you want to target users (via system, frequency, segments,
  geography, etc.).

  For mobile campaigns, **system targeting** is one of the most useful
  ways to reach users. You can include or exclude users via the types of
  devices they use (phone, tablet, pc), their device makes and models
  (i.e., Apple iPhone, HTC Droid Incredible, etc.), their operating
  systems, the browsers on their devices, and their mobile carriers and
  connection types (carrier-based or wifi/static). For details, see
  <a href="system-targeting.md" class="xref">System Targeting</a>.

  

  <b>Note:</b> Inventory Quality does not
  apply to in-app inventory. Mobile campaigns will deliver on in-app
  inventory regardless of your campaigns Inventory Quality setting.

  

Step 1. Start a new campaign

On the Advertiser Details screen,
click Create New
 \>  Campaign.

You can find
Create New
 \>  Campaign on the
insertion order, line item, and campaign screens under the advertiser as
well.

This opens the initial Create New
Campaign screen.

Step 2. Select the parent line item

In the Select a Line Item section,
select the line item under which you want to create your campaign and
then click Continue. If you are
creating your campaign directly from a line item or there is only one
line item associated with the advertiser, the line item is selected by
default.

You can use the search field to find a particular line item by name or
ID. Also, all active and inactive line items are listed by default, but
you can use the filter to the right of the search field to show just
active or inactive line items.

Step 3. Select the campaign type

In the Campaign Type section, select
Buy direct/third-party inventory. This
will reveal the full workflow for setting up a campaign.

You can expand or collapse each section of the screen as you like. To
expand or collapse all sections at once, click the **Expand All** or
Collapse All link in the upper right.



<b>Note:</b> changing the campaign type will
reset your workflow and available targeting options.



Step 4. Enter basic details and flight dates

In the Basic Setup section, enter the
basic details and flight dates for the campaign.

- **Name** - Enter the name for the campaign. You will later be able to
  search for and report on the campaign using this name.
- **External Code** - If you want to report on the campaign using an
  external code (rather than the internal ID that
  Xandr assigns automatically), enter the code
  here.
- **State** - The state is set to "Inactive" by default to prevent the
  campaign from spending before all necessary settings and creatives are
  complete. You can set the state to "Active" at any time.
- **Flight Dates** - Set the start for the campaign and set an end date
  or select Run Indefinitely. Note
  that the time format (12-hour or 24-hour) and time zone are inherited
  from the advertiser. Enter or select the start and end dates and times
  for the campaign.
  

  <b>Note:</b> If flight dates are set for the
  parent line item, those dates take precedence; regardless of the dates
  set for the campaign, the campaign will not start before the line item
  start date and will not continue buying impressions after the line
  item end date. To further limit serving to specific days and hours of
  the week, you can use
  <a href="daypart-targeting.md" class="xref">Daypart Targeting</a>.

  

Step 5. Set the campaign budget

By default, your campaign media **Budget** is unlimited. If you prefer,
you can define exactly how much you are willing to spend on buying
inventory for the campaign. The budget can be in impressions or in media
cost (dollars). Note that media cost is in USD rather than the
advertiser's currency because USD is the currency in which
Xandr transacts.

You can set budgets at the insertion order and line item levels as well.
Budgets at these levels take precedence over a child campaign's budget;
if they run out, the campaign will stop buying impressions, whether or
not it has reached its own budget.

- **Lifetime** - This is the budget that you are willing to spend over
  the entire lifetime of the campaign. There are two options:
  - **Custom** - Select this option to enter a specific amount of
    impressions or dollars.
  - **Unlimited** - Select this option to leave your lifetime budget
    undefined.
    

    <b>Note:</b> If **Lifetime** budget is set
    to **Unlimited** and the line item and insertion order lifetime
    budgets are also set to **Unlimited** severe overspend can occur.

    
- **Daily** - This is the budget that you are willing to spend on any
  single day. There are three options:
  - **Custom** - Select this option to enter a specific amount of
    impressions or dollars. When you enter a custom daily budget, you
    must select one of the following options:
    - **Pace evenly throughout the day** - Select this option, otherwise
      known as "daily pacing", if you want to prevent your daily budget
      from being spent all at once by distributing your spend evenly by
      hour throughout the day. Note that if you use Daypart Targeting to
      restrict the hours during which the campaign can serve, daily
      pacing will adjust to distribute your spend evenly across only the
      targeted hours. For more details, see
      <a href="daypart-targeting.md" class="xref">Daypart Targeting</a>.
    - **Spend as fast as possible** - Select this option if you do not
      want to pace your daily budget at all. Note that this option could
      lead to your entire daily budget being spent in a very short
      amount of time.
  - **Pace Lifetime Budget** - Select this option to spread your
    lifetime budget evenly across your flight dates. As each day passes,
    the system spreads the remaining impression or media cost budget
    across the remaining days of the flight.
    - The system is not able to pace its spending if it does not have a
      budget amount, and the system must know the number of days in the
      campaign in order to apply the remaining budget amount equally for
      the remainder of the flight. Therefore, this option requires that
      you enter a custom lifetime budget and select an end date.
  - **Unlimited** - Select this option to leave your daily budget
    undefined.
    

    <b>Note:</b> If you have enabled the
    unlimited budget warning feature, you will not be able to set the
    budget for your campaign to **unlimited** if the line item and (if
    applicable) insertion order budgets are also set to unlimited. This
    feature prevents mistaken overspend that can result when budgets are
    set to unlimited at all levels. When the feature is enabled, to set
    your campaign budget to unlimited, you must first limit the budget
    for either the insertion order or line item associated with the
    campaign. To enable this feature, speak to your
    Xandr representative.

    

Step 6. Define the buying strategies

Buy Third-Party Inventory

To run the campaign on inventory from other members of the
Xandr platform and from external partners and
exchanges (also known as **RTB** inventory), check the **Buy Third-Party
Inventory** box. Then decide how you want to pay for third-party
inventory (per impression, per click, and/or per conversion) and define
exactly how you want to calculate your bids. Note that the revenue type
of the parent line item determines which buying strategy options are
available and, of those available, which are recommended.

Post-view conversions cannot currently be tracked across Safari mobile
browsers or in apps. If you use the "Optimize to a predicted CPA goal"
strategy, please do so only for post-click scenarios. For more
information about why this is so, see
<a href="technical-limitations-of-mobile-buying.md"
class="xref">Technical Limitations of Mobile Buying</a>.

Post-click conversion tracking works in mobile browsers just like it
does in web browsers. In mobile apps, however, post-click conversions
can be tracked only when the user performs the action (the conversion)
from an app's built-in web view. After clicking an ad in an app, if the
user converts in a separate mobile browser (after having closed the
app), the correlation to the click in the app cannot be tracked.

When your line item booked revenue is CPM but you want your campaign to
optimize to a CPC or CPA goal, for best results, set a **Performance
Goal** on your line item and use **Optimize to a % Margin of Booked
Revenue** as your campaign buying strategy.

Pay on a Per-impression (CPM) basis

Select this option to pay publishers for every impression. This payment
type is accepted by all sellers (Xandr sellers
and external sellers).

- **Optimize to a % margin of booked revenue**

  Use this strategy to bid a % margin of the revenue that the advertiser
  pays you. For example, if your booked revenue is $1 CPM, and you set a
  bidding strategy margin of 25%, your campaign will bid $0.75. If your
  booked revenue type is a CPA or CPC goal, it will apply your desired
  margin and optimize to that predicted goal.

  - **Bid CPM: max \_ $ CPM min \_ $ CPM** - Enter the highest and
    lowest CPM dollar amount that you are willing to spend on an
    impression.
  - **Enable Cadence Modifier** - Under **OTHER OPTIONS**, check this
    box to vary your bid based on how often and recently users have seen
    your creatives. This feature is based on the idea that an ad is more
    effective (and therefore worth more) when a user hasn't seen it
    before or hasn't seen it many times or seen it recently.

- **Optimize to a predicted CPA goal**

  Use this strategy to vary bids based on the likelihood of an
  attributed conversion for each piece of inventory. This strategy uses
  the Xandr optimization engine.

  - **Bid $ \_\_ post-click/post-view CPA** - Select the conversion
    pixel to which you want to optimize and enter the dollar amount per
    conversion that you want the optimization engine to aim for.
  - **Learn Budget** - The learn budget is the portion of your campaign
    budget that you want to commit to optimizing your campaign, which
    helps you quickly find slices of third-party inventory that provide
    a positive ROI. The first phase of this process is called Learn. You
    can set a lifetime learn budget of up to 100% of the campaign budget
    as well as a daily cap for learning.
  - **Bid at most $ \_\_ CPM in Learn Phase** - When your campaign
    starts to spend on new inventory, the optimization engine submits
    "learn" bids. If necessary, enter max CPM dollar amount for these
    bids. <b>Note:</b> When you set both a cap for learn bids and a max CPM for
    non-learn bids (next option), the lower of the two will be used for
    learn.
  - **Bid CPM: max $ \_ CPM min $ \_ CPM** - Enter the highest and
    lowest CPM dollar amount that you are willing to spend on an
    impression.
  - **Enable Cadence Modifier** - This option appears under
    OTHER OPTIONS and cannot be
    deselected. When optimizing to a predicted CPA goal, your bids will
    always vary based on how often and recently users have seen your
    creatives. This feature is based on the idea that an ad is more
    effective (and therefore worth more) when a user hasn't seen it
    before or hasn't seen it many times or seen it recently.

- **Optimize to a predicted CPC goal**

  Use this strategy to vary bids based on the likelihood of a click for
  each piece of inventory. This strategy uses the
  Xandr optimization engine. {expand:Expand to
  see more options}

  - **Optimize to $ \_\_ per click** - Enter the dollar amount per click
    that you want the optimization engine to aim for when calculating
    bids.
  - **Learn Budget** - The learn budget is the portion of your campaign
    budget that you want to commit to optimizing your campaign, which
    helps you quickly find slices of third-party inventory that provide
    a positive ROI. The first phase of this process is called Learn. You
    can set a lifetime learn budget of up to 100% of the campaign budget
    as well as a daily cap for learning.
  - **Bid at most $ \_\_ CPM in Learn Phase** - When your campaign
    starts to spend on new inventory, the optimization engine submits
    "learn" bids. It is recommended to enter a max CPM dollar about for
    these bids. In doing so, you will avoid learning on inventory that
    is too expensive while not limiting yourself from optimized
    inventory sources that are worth higher prices. <b>Note:</b> When you set
    both a cap for learn bids and a max CPM for non-learn bids (next
    option), the lower of the two will be used for learn.
  - **Bid CPM: max $ \_ CPM min $ \_ CPM** - Enter the highest and
    lowest CPM dollar amount that you are willing to spend on an
    impression.
  - **Enable Cadence Modifier** - This option appears under
    OTHER OPTIONS and cannot be
    deselected. When optimizing to a predicted CPA goal, your bids will
    always vary based on how often and recently users have seen your
    creatives. This feature is based on the idea that an ad is more
    effective (and therefore worth more) when a user hasn't seen it
    before or hasn't seen it many times or seen it recently.

- **Bid a base $ \_\_ CPM** - Use this strategy to bid a fixed dollar
  amount.

- **Base CPM $ \_\_** - Enter the fixed dollar amount to bid per
  thousand impressions.

- **Enable Cadence Modifier** - Under **OTHER OPTIONS**, check this box
  to vary your bid based on how often and recently users have seen your
  creatives. This feature is based on the idea that an ad is more
  effective (and therefore worth more) when a user hasn't seen it before
  or hasn't seen it many times or seen it recently.
  - **Bid CPM: max $ \_ CPM min $ \_ CPM** - This option is available
    under OTHER OPTIONS only once you
    enable Cadence Modifier. Enter the highest and lowest CPM dollar
    amount that you are willing to spend on an impression.

**Target reach and delivery (bid via ECP or EAP)**

Use this strategy to bid the going platform rate for each piece of
inventory.

- **Auto-bid to win most platform impressions (ECP)** - Select this
  option to bid an estimate of the price that is likely to win most
  impressions from Xandr platform sellers based
  on historical bids and their success or failure. Since off-platform
  sellers (e.g., Google Ad Manager, Rubicon, etc.) conduct a secondary
  auction, bidding ECP does not necessarily ensure winning off-platform
  impressions.
- **Auto-bid to win ~50% of platform impressions (EAP)** - Select this
  option to bid an estimate of the price that is likely to win about
  half of the impressions from Xandr platform
  sellers based on historical bids and their success or failure. Since
  off-platform sellers (e.g., Google Ad Manager, Rubicon, etc.) conduct
  a secondary auction, bidding EAP does not necessarily ensure winning
  half of off-platform impressions.
- **Bid CPM: max $ \_ CPM min $ \_ CPM** - Enter the highest and lowest
  CPM dollar amount that you are willing to spend on an impression.
- **Enable Cadence Modifier** - Under **OTHER OPTIONS**, check this box
  to vary your bid based on how often and recently users have seen your
  creatives. This feature is based on the idea that an ad is more
  effective (and therefore worth more) when a user hasn't seen it before
  or hasn't seen it many times or seen it recently.
- **Pay on a Per-click (CPC) basis** - Select this option to pay
  publishers only when users click on your ads. This payment type is
  accepted only by participating Xandr sellers,
  not by external sellers; using it exclusively may therefore decrease
  your campaign's reach.
- **Pay $ \_ per click** - Enter the dollar amount to pay a publisher
  when a user clicks on one of your ads.
- **Pay on a Per-conversion (CPA) basis** - Select this option to pay
  publishers only when users convert. This payment type is accepted only
  by participating Xandr sellers, not by
  external sellers; using it exclusively may therefore decrease your
  campaign's reach.
- **Pay $ \_** **post-click/post-view CPA** - For each selected
  conversion pixel, enter the dollar amount to pay a publisher when a
  viewed or clicked ad leads to a conversion.

Step 7. Show to users without cookies

To target users that you have not seen before and users who have cleared
their cookies, check the **Show to users without cookies** box under
Buying
Strategies  \>  OTHER
OPTIONS.



<b>Note:</b> If using frequency targeting for
this campaign, you must also check the **Show to users without cookies**
box in the Frequency section of the
**Targeting** area. For more details, see
<a href="frequency-and-recency-caps.md" class="xref"
title="From the Audience &amp; Location Targeting section, you can apply frequency and recency caps to your line item to prevent overexposure by limiting how many (frequency) and how often (recency) creatives are shown to a user. You can use the Creative Frequency and Recency Report to view how often and how frequently users are viewing a specific advertiser&#39;s creatives.">Frequency
and Recency Caps</a>.



Your campaign will show ads to users without cookies by default when
conversion tracking is enabled at the line item level (one or more
conversion pixels are attached to the line item). In this case,
targeting users without cookies is not the default because we cannot
attribute conversions back to an impression view or click when users do
not have cookies.

Targeting cookieless users does not affect mobile app targeting. Almost
all in-app inventory has a device ID associated with it; this device ID
is then associated with one of our platform cookies.

For mobile web campaigns, checking **Show to users without cookies** is
currently the only way to serve ads to Safari users, since Safari
disables third-party (advertising) cookies by default.

Step 8. Set optimization levers

If your buying strategy uses the Xandr
optimization engine, you can adjust **Optimization Levers** to influence
how optimization works for your campaign, for example, how much you bid
during the Learn phase, how many success events (clicks or conversions)
it takes to move from the Learn phase to the Optimized phase, as well as
whether you want to optimize to the campaign bidding strategy before
optimizing to the line item booked revenue.

To access optimization levers, click the
Edit button under
Buying
Strategies  \>  OTHER
OPTIONS.

If you do not have access to optimization levers and are interested in
learning more about about them, please contact your
Xandr account representative.

Step 9. Add targeting

Use the links below to learn more about each type of targeting.

- <a href="buy-mobile-inventory-via-rtb.html#ID-00006929__p_eys_hft_1kb"
  class="xref">buy-mobile-inventory-via-rtb.html#ID-00006929__p_eys_hft_1kb</a>
- <a href="buy-mobile-inventory-via-rtb.html#ID-00006929__p_u1x_3ft_1kb"
  class="xref">buy-mobile-inventory-via-rtb.html#ID-00006929__p_u1x_3ft_1kb</a>

When you apply multiple types of targeting (e.g., inventory, segment,
geography, etc.), keep in mind that your campaign will buy only
impressions that match all targeting. In other words, there is an AND
relationship between the main types of targeting. For example, if you
target seller 123, segment ABC, and the United States, your campaign
will bid only on impressions from that seller being viewed by users in
that segment and in the United States.

Target inventory

You can target inventory in numerous ways. Use the links below to learn
more about each type of inventory targeting.

- <a href="page-properties-targeting.md" class="xref"
  title="Through page properties targeting, you can target impressions based on the position of the creative tag on the page or based on values passed in the query string of the ad call.">Page
  Properties Targeting</a>



<b>Note:</b> The majority of mobile supply is
external. Although some supply partners categorize their inventory, note
that including categories will exclude all uncategorized mobile supply
from your campaign.



Target users

You can target users in numerous ways. Use the links below to learn more
about each type of user targeting.

- <a href="segment-targeting.md" class="xref"
  title="You can target users within segments by using Boolean expressions. Users get added to segments after they&#39;ve viewed or clicked a particular creative.">Segment
  Targeting</a>
- <a href="frequency-and-recency-caps.md" class="xref"
  title="From the Audience &amp; Location Targeting section, you can apply frequency and recency caps to your line item to prevent overexposure by limiting how many (frequency) and how often (recency) creatives are shown to a user. You can use the Creative Frequency and Recency Report to view how often and how frequently users are viewing a specific advertiser&#39;s creatives.">Frequency

- <a href="system-targeting.md" class="xref">System Targeting</a>
- <a href="demography-targeting.md" class="xref">Demography
  Targeting</a>

Step 10. Associate creatives and define a dynamic landing page

In the Associated Creatives section,
you can select a **Creative Rotation** to determine how you want to
rotate and weight multiple creatives. Select one of three options:

- **Evenly weight creatives** (default): Even rotation is handled
  automatically by our system.
- **Auto-optimize creative weight**: When this option is chosen, 75% of
  delivery is allocated to the creative with the highest click-through
  rate; all remaining creatives of the same size receive equal
  allocations of the remaining 25% of overall delivery.
- **Manually weight creatives**: By selecting this option, you will be
  able to manually set a weight (between 0 and 1000).

Click Edit and select the creatives
that you want to run for the campaign. Also, if you want to define a
dynamic landing page to be used by multiple creatives associated to the
campaign, enter the **Landing Page URL** and then make sure the
creatives are set up to use a dynamic landing page. Note that you can
set a dynamic landing page at the line item level as well. For more
details, see <a href="dynamic-landing-pages.md" class="xref"
title="As an advertiser, you may wish to send users to different landing pages or compare the performance of different landing pages. To accomplish this, you can associate a landing page URL with a line item. This landing page will then be available for association with any creatives that are attached to that line item.">Dynamic
Landing Pages</a>.

Step 11. Enter comments

In the Comments section, enter any
comments that you would like to record with the campaign. Comments are
for your reference only and will not affect campaign delivery.

Step 12. Add serving fees

If you owe serving fees to third parties for services such as creative
hosting or user data, you can add these fees in the
Serving Fees section. Serving fees can
be either a percentage of costs or a flat CPM. Please note the
following:

- Serving fees are added to your media cost.
- When you use a third-party buying strategy that involves optimization
  ("Optimize to a predicted CPA/CPC goal" or "Optimize to a % margin of
  booked revenue"), bids are automatically reduced to account for
  serving fees.
- When you buy direct inventory or use a third-party buying strategy
  that does not involve optimization, bids are not reduced to account
  for serving fees.

To add a new serving fee:

1.  Click the Add Fee button.
2.  In the Broker field, select the
    relevant broker or create a new broker.
3.  In the Description field, enter
    details about the serving fee.
4.  Select the **Fee Type** (CPM or Cost Share) and enter the relevant
    **Fee Value** (dollar amount for CPM, percentage for Revenue Share).
5.  Click Add.



<b>Important:</b> Per broker, you can add no
more than one CPM serving fee and one Cost Share serving fee.



Step 13. Review and save your campaign

Confirm that the campaign details are correct and then click the
Save button to finish adding the
campaign to Xandr.

Step 14. Complete peer approval



<b>Tip:</b> When activated for a user at the
network level, the campaign peer approval feature requires a user to get
approval from a second user before campaigns can be set to **Active**.
This feature minimizes the risk of user-side errors in campaign
activation and can help users identify and change settings to improve
campaign performance.





<b>Note:</b> This step applies only to clients
who have enabled the peer approval feature for their users. To learn
more about enabling peer approval for users, see
<a href="create-a-user.md" class="xref">Create a User</a>.





<b>Note:</b> The campaign peer approval
feature sets requirements for who must obtain peer approval, but not who
can approve campaigns. Any other user who is able to create campaigns
for your network may provide this approval. There is no way to designate
a single approver of others' campaigns.



If your campaigns use the peer approval feature, in order to switch a
campaign's status from Inactive to Active, you will need peer approval
from another user. In the Create New
Campaign screen in the Approved
By field, you will see a message alerting you to the need for
peer approval and will be unable to save the campaign in an active
state.

To approve the campaign, another user from your team must log in, go to
the Campaigns screen, select the
desired campaign and click Edit. This
will open the Edit Campaign screen. On
the Edit Campaign screen, the
alternate user must check the **Approved By** checkbox. Once this step
is completed, the campaign can be set to **Active** by any user on your
team.
