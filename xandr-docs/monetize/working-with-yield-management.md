Yield management (YM) tools allow networks and their publishers to set floor (minimum bid price) and bias (bid modifying) rules that enable you to exert more control over impression pricing. These tools help you to serve creatives with the highest yields for publishers, allow publishers to express preferences for creatives from certain buyers over others,
and avoid channel conflict with directly negotiated deals.

YM rules are set up per publisher and can apply to various impression properties including:

- The specific audience the network is trying to reach, based on geographic region or marketing segment
- The type of creatives that are most desired, e.g., those that synchronize with the publisher's content
- Whether the creatives involved would create channel conflict
