# Managing Relationships with Sellers



Buyers use the Partner Center to
foster and manage relationships with specific sellers.

As a buyer, you can use the Partner
Center to:

- Communicate with sellers directly in Monetize
  using the Activity Stream
- Leverage more overall spend for targeting access and/or lower
  impression prices
- Track spend on a specific seller's inventory to gain insight into the
  partnership and trends
- <a href="partner-center-screen-buyer-view.html" class="xref">Partner

  all sellers, set preferred sellers, and review impression and click
  statistics for each seller.
