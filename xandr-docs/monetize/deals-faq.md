# Deals FAQ

## Deal FAQs for Sellers

### How do I offer deals to buyers?

As a seller, you can use deals to provide buyers special access to your inventory and/or data. For example, a deal might provide preferential pricing on inventory, access to exclusive inventory, reduced competition on inventory, or other opportunities.

There are two ways to offer deals to buyers:

- **Packages**: Packages are pre-made combinations of your inventory and/or data. Buyers can browse your packages and create deals from them "off-the-shelf", or they can use your packages as a jumping-off point for deal negotiations.
- **Deals**: In cases where your packages don't meet a buyer's needs, you can create a one-off custom deal for the buyer. For more details, see [Create a Package](create-a-package.md) and [Create a Custom Deal](create-a-custom-deal.md).

### Where can I view and manage my packages and deals?

You can use the **Packages** screen to search your packages, view details about specific packages, edit package settings, create new packages, preview how your packages look to buyers, share your packages with buyers, and more. For more details, see [Manage Your Packages](manage-your-packages.md).

You can use the **Deals** screen to view deal details, monitor each deal's health, trigger detailed reports, edit or cancel deals, and create new deals. For more details, see [Manage Your Deals with Buyers](manage-your-deals-with-buyers.md).

### What can I include in a package or deal?

You can select specific inventory, segments, sizes, or brands to include in your deal. For more information, see [Create a Package](create-a-package.md) and [Create a Custom Deal](create-a-custom-deal.md).

### Can I create a guaranteed deal for a buyer?

No. Having a deal, even a private auction deal, does NOT guarantee that the buyer will always win the deal inventory. As with RTB, there may be other buyers competing for the deal inventory.

### Can I create a deal with external buyers?

Yes. For a list of supported external buyers and guidance on setting up deals with them, see [Negotiate Deals with Buyers](negotiate-deals-with-buyers.md).

### What is the difference between exposing a placement to a buyer and creating a deal for a placement?

Exposing a placement to the buyer allows the buyer to view the placement when selecting campaign targeting and in reporting. If you create a deal for a placement, the buyer can target the placement inventory by targeting the deal, regardless of whether the placement is exposed or hidden.

### When should I use a YM floor, and when should I use a deal price?

Use YM floors to define a minimum price for specific inventory. Use a deal price to define a minimum price for a specific buyer.

### How do my YM floors interact with deal prices?

Deal prices take priority over floor prices. If you have a deal with no ask price, that is considered a deal with no floor. Your existing YM floor rules will apply to the deal inventory. If you have a deal with an ask price of 0, that is considered a deal with a floor of 0. The deal floor of 0 will take priority over any YM floors you have. For more information on deal pricing and YM rules, see [Deal Auction Mechanics](deal-auction-mechanics.md).

## Deal FAQs for Buyers

### How do I get deals from sellers?

A deal is an agreement between a buyer and a seller that provides special access to inventory and/or data. As a Monetize buyer, there are two ways to strikes deals with sellers:

- [Get Deals from Seller Packages](get-deals-from-seller-packages.md) - Browse Monetize sellers' pre-made combinations of inventory and/or data and immediately convert them into deals or use them as a jumping-off point for custom deal negotiations
- [Negotiate Deals with Sellers](negotiate-deals-with-sellers.md) - If you don't find packages that meet your needs, kick off negotiations for one-off deals with sellers.

### Where can I view and manage my deals?

You can view, manage, and create deals on the [Partnership Details Screen - Buyer View](partnership-details-screen-buyer-view.md) in the [Partner Center Screen - Buyer View](partner-center-screen-buyer-view.md).

### Can I create a deal with external sellers?
