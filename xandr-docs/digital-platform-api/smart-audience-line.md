This article outlines how the Smart audience line serves performance campaigns for Microsoft Invest customers with the aim of enhancing Return on Ad Spend (ROAS). It involves accessing advertising inventory and leveraging bidding strategies to optimize performance.

## Process flow
The process begins with the advertiser configuring the following components within the Microsoft Invest Demand Side Platform (DSP):

- Smart Insertion Order(s)
- Smart Line Item(s)
- Profile
- Creative(s)

When the customer implements the Smart audience line feature to set up the objects in Microsoft Invest, specific attributes for budgeting, configurations, and targeting parameters are incorporated into the Smart Insertion Order and Smart Line Item. These parameters are sent to an object translation layer, which then integrates performance demand from Microsoft Invest into Microsoft Ads. Once saved on the Microsoft Ads platform, the bidder leverages automated bidding strategies to execute the advertiser's campaigns.
