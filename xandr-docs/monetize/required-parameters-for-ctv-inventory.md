# Required tag parameters for CTV inventory

You can use a single combined tag for CTV, or create separate tags for each device type. When identifying the device, using `ifa` and `ifa_type` is recommended: if you can't use these parameters, you can use `openudid`.

> [!NOTE]
> You will need  need additional parameters such as width and height to monetize your inventory, unless these values have been set on the placement.

The following examples show how to implement a server-side tag with `ifa`/`ifa_type` or , if `ifa` and `ifa_type` can't be used, with `openudid`.

| Parameter | Type | Required? | Compatible Handlers | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| `appid` (CTV) | string | Yes | `ptv`, `ssptv`, `vmap`, `ssvmap` | This string is used to identify an app running on a ConnectedTV device such as Apple TV, Fire TV, Android TV, or Roku.<br> - On Android, this is the app's package name. It's formatted as follows: `com.example.helloworld`.<br> - On iOS, this is the app's numeric iOS store ID, auto-generated by the App Store. It's formatted as follows: `123456789`. <br> Many buyers set campaign targeting and reporting based on `appid`. Failing to supply a correct `appid` will make your inventory unattractive to these buyers. Therefore, passing this field is strongly recommended when `supply_type` is set to `mobile_app`.<br>To find the app ID for a particular Android or IOS app, find the app's detail page, which you can find using a web search. The URL of the app store's detail page will show the app's ID.<br>For example, here are the detail pages for the "Fussball" app:<br> - Google Play: `https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.telekom.FUSSBALL.DE`<br> - iTunes: `https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/fussball.de/id422052549` |
