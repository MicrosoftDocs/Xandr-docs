# Companions



A companion is a creative that is commonly displayed in the form of a
standard banner or rich media. It can also wrap the video ad experience.
Companions are supported on VAST version 2.0 and higher.



Companions are typically served with linear or non-linear creatives. The
following rendering modes can be used to indicate when and where the
companion should display:

headers="companions__table_d5561da5-638f-4341-9cde-f7e1f4331c59__entry__2">Depending
upon the player's default behavior, the companion will either be
rendered after the video playback has stopped (end-card) or alongside
the video or audio creative for the entire duration of the video
playback (concurrent).</td>
