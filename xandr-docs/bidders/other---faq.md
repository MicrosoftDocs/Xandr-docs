# Other - FAQ

## Data providers

### Do you work with data providers?

Yes, we work with several data providers, including contextual and behavioral. Reach out to your Xandr representative if you would like to work with data providers on the platform.

### How does the data from a data provider come in the bid request?

The bid request includes the segments for the impression. Both contextual and behavioral data providers have segments that correspond to relevant data. These segments will be sent in the bid request.

## Requests and responses

### What is the `click_request` and `click_response`?

The [Click Request](click-request.md) is used if you would like Xandr to help track clicks. This is primarily useful to our bidder clients that have built their bidders on the Xandr framework. If you are interested in using the click request and response, reach out to your technical and account contacts.

## Sample code

### Do you have an implementation of your APIs in a certain language?

No, we do not have a public, up-to-date, supported implementation of our APIs in any language.

## Selling inventory

### Can I sell inventory through Xandr?

Selling requires a separate contract. If you are interested in selling inventory, then reach out to your account contact.

## Partner inventory vs. platform inventory

### What is the difference between partner and platform inventory?

Partner inventory is comprised of impressions that come from other exchanges, such as Google Ad Manager, Rubicon, AdMeld, etc. Platform inventory is made up of impressions that are resold by networks representing publishers.

### How does price reduction work?
