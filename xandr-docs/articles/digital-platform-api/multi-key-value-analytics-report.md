# Multi key value analytics report

The Multi Key Value Analytics report shows you the information associated with your network's defined targeting keys and values. This report helps seller need to view different keys associated with the same bid as a flat report and enables users to filter the report based on their keys. Currently, it is available to selected partners only (3 partners or 3 keys).

Impressions with key/value targeting will serve and be reported only for those impressions that were logged by a placement tag containing the **kw\_** prefix on the key name. For example, a placement tag containing *keyname=value1* will not serve and therefore not be logged, whereas a placement tag containing *kw_keyname=value1* will serve and be logged. This applies to ad calls with the following tag types: `/tt`, `/ttj`, `/fpt`, `/jpt`, `/pt`, `/ptv`, `/ssptv`, `/mtj`, `/map`, and `/mob`.

> [!NOTE]
> **AppNexus Seller Tags**
>
> When using [Seller Tag](../seller-tag/seller-tag.md), omit the **kw\_** prefix. AST has the `keyword` object in the body of the request, so the prefix is not needed.

Not all impressions from key/value targets will be included in reports. To be included, the targets must meet the following criteria:

- Key must be pre-defined. See the [Pre-Defining Targeting Keys and Values](../monetize/pre-defining-targeting-keys-and-values.md) page in the UI for more information.
- Value must be pre-defined OR Value must be targeted by at least one line item or campaign.
- Value is not a numeric range (greater than or less than).
- Value does not include a wildcard.

## Time frame

The `report_interval` field in the JSON request can be set to one of the following:

- custom
- today
- last_24_hours
- yesterday
- last_48_hours
- last_7_days
- month_to_date
- quarter_to_date

**Data retention period**

Data in this report is retained for 428 days.

> [!NOTE]
> To run a report for a custom time frame, set the `start_date` and `end_date` fields in your report request. For more details about these fields, see [Report Service](./report-service.md).

## Example

### Create the JSON report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` of `"multi_key_value_analytics"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the `"format"` in which the data should be returned (`"csv"`, `"excel"`, or `"html"`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md).

```
$ cat multi_key_value_analytics

{"report":
    {
        "report_type":"multi_key_value_analytics",
        "columns":[
            "hour",
            "seller_member_id",
            "reporting_key_1_name",
            "reporting_key_1_name_label",
            "reporting_key_1_value",
            "reporting_key_1_value_label",
            "imps",
            "clicks",
            "revenue",
            "revenue_pub_curr"
        ],
        "report_interval":"last_48_hours",
        "format":"csv"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the [report service](./report-service.md)

`POST` the JSON request to get back a report ID.

```
$ curl -b cookies -X post -d @multi_key_value_analytics "https://api.appnexus.com/report?advertiser_id=123"

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"09b6979a6a4c3805bdac8921378d3622"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service

Make a `GET` call with the report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=09b6979a6a4c3805bdac8921378d3622'

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report":{
         "name":null,
         "created_on":"2016-12-11 19:15:48",
         "json_request": "{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"multi_key_value_analytics\",
             \"columns\":[\"hour\",\"seller_member_id\",
             \"reporting_key_1_name\",\"reporting_key_1_name_label\",\"reporting_key_1_value\",\"reporting_key_1_value_label\",
             \"imps\",\"clicks\",\"revenue\",\"revenue_pub_curr\"],
             \"report_interval\":\"last_48_hours\",\"format\":\"csv\",\"filters\":[{\"advertiser_id\":\"123\"}]}}",
             "url":"report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592"
      },
      "execution_status":"ready"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and report ID in the `url` field of the response to your previous `GET` call. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the file format that you specified in your initial `POST`.

If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592' > /tmp/multi_key_value_analytics.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
