# Using the buyer monitoring grids

Microsoft Invest consists of these three grids: **Advertisers**, **Insertion Orders**, and **Line Items**. These buyer monitoring grids help campaign managers monitor delivery and performance for insertion orders and line items across advertisers.

## Viewing metrics

Various metrics are available and organized as follows per grid:

| Grid | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Advertisers | Metrics are organized by advertiser to present a holistic delivery and performance outlook for each one. |
| Insertion Orders and Line Items | Metrics are organized by object.<br> The **Insertion Orders** and **Line Items** grids consist of three tabs: **Upcoming**, **In Progress**, and **Completed**. Insertion orders and line items move into the:<br> - **Upcoming** tab on the hour that they go live.<br> - **In Progress** tab when they are between flights (start date/time of the first flight and end date/time of the last flight).<br> - **Completed** tab on the hour that they have completed.<br><br> The metrics provided on these tabs will vary. |

These metrics are cached regularly to provide fast access. Use the tooltips that display at the top of each column to better understand how these metrics are calculated.

> [!NOTE]
> Because these metrics are cached more regularly than the reporting data, there may be discrepancies between them. For more information, see [Availability of Reporting Data](./availability-of-reporting-data.md).

## Searching for objects

You can use the search field at the top of the buyer monitoring grids to search for objects by name, ID, or code.

> [!NOTE]
> Inactive objects will display with their name, ID, and metrics grayed out.

If you don't know the specific name, ID, or code for an object, search for it using the pagination functionality at the bottom of the grids:

1. Select the number of rows that you want to display per page by selecting a value from the **Rows per page** menu.
1. Enter a specific page in the designated text field or click the right arrow to navigate from page to page.

## Configuring custom filters

You can create, apply, and save custom filters. To configure custom filters:

1. Click **Advanced Filters**.
1. Make your selections.
1. Click the arrow to the right of the **Apply** button.
1. Select **Apply and Save As**. To apply a filter to the grid without saving it for future use, click the **Apply** button.
1. Enter a name for the new filter.
1. Select the **Make Default** checkbox if you want the filter to be automatically applied to the grid by default.
1. Click the **Apply and Save As** button.<br>
   All saved filters are available from the **Select a Filter** pull-down menu. To remove an applied filter, click **Clear All**. You can update any saved filter at any time. To update any of the saved filters, click the **Edit** link or click **Advanced Filters**. From the **Advanced Filters** dialog, you can rename, delete, or make the saved filter a default filter.

## Sorting and showing/hiding columns

Click the name of the column to sort columns in ascending or descending order.

You can also choose the columns that you want to show or hide by clicking **Modify Columns**. This opens the **Modify Columns** dialog. Select or deselect the columns that you want to show or hide.

## Viewing object details

To view specific object details, click anywhere in the corresponding row in the grid. From the **Details** pane, you can view the necessary details for that object and additional details for child objects.

To view child object details:

1. Click the **Associated Objects** menu on the right of the **Details** pane.
1. Select the appropriate object category such as **Creatives**.
