# Microsoft Monetize -  Move a placement to a different placement group

A placement is an open slot on a publisher website where an advertiser creative with matching specifications can serve. Placement groups provide a way for you to organize and manage placements apply default inventory categorization and self-auditing criteria to child placements. This page explains how to move a placement to a new placement group.

## 1. Get started

**Publisher-only clients:** Select **Placements** from the **Inventory** menu in the main navigation menu, then select the publisher you want to work with from the **Select a Publisher** dialog.

**All other clients:** Go to **Publishers  \>  Placement** Manager. This takes you to the Placement Manager screen, which shows both the **Placement Group List** and
the **Placement List** under each placement group for the publisher.

## 2. Move the desired placements to a different placement group

Check the checkbox for the placement under which you want to move to another new placement group, then click **More Actions \>  Move**. This will open the **Select a destination placement group** dialog. Click Select to complete the action. If you want to move more than one placement to the same group, you can move them all at once by checking multiple boxes.

## 3. Review the placement list

In the **Placement Group List,** click the placement group under which you moved the placement. You should see the placements you moved show up in the **Placement List** for that placement group.
