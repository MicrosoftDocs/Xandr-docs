# July 08, 2025 - Updates to Inventory Manager

We’ve enhanced Inventory Manager in Microsoft Monetize with a modernized, streamlined workflow designed to simplify the creation and editing of placements across all media types. This includes:
 
- **Unified workflow:** Previously there were separate workflows for Display and In-stream video objects. The updated experience has a single, unified workflow to easily create multi-format placements, as well as change media type configurations (For example, from in-stream to in-article) within the interface. 
- **Simplified design:** An intuitive layout that prioritizes fields most critical to monetization, enabling consumers to make informed decisions more quickly.
