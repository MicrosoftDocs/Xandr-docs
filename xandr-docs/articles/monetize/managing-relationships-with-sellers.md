# Microsoft Monetize - Managing relationships with sellers

Buyers use the **Partner Center** to
foster and manage relationships with specific sellers.

As a buyer, you can use the **Partner
Center** to:

- Communicate with sellers directly in Monetize
  using the Activity Stream
- Leverage more overall spend for targeting access and/or lower
  impression prices
- Track spend on a specific seller's inventory to gain insight into the
  partnership and trends
- [Partner Center Screen - Buyer View](partner-center-screen-buyer-view.md) - View your preferred partners, search
  all sellers, set preferred sellers, and review impression and click
  statistics for each seller.
- [Partnership Details Screen - Buyer View](partnership-details-screen-buyer-view.md) - Review and
  manage your relationship with a specific seller by tracking overall
  spend trends, view your top brands on the seller's inventory, view the
  seller's top publishers from whom you have purchased inventory, view
  seller statistics, and send messages directly to the seller in
  Monetize.
- [Customize Your Buyer Profile](customize-your-buyer-profile.md) - Step-by-step instructions for editing the profile
  information that displays to sellers on your **Partner Details** page.
