# Seat service

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is currently in Closed Beta. If you are interested in participating, please reach out to your Xandr representative.

The Buyer Seat ID product allows for external bidders to bid with their custom buyer IDs rather than using Xandr member IDs. This allows external bidders to utilize buyer IDs from their own systems when bidding on Xandr inventory and will allow for more seamless reporting and deal set up.

The seat service is a brand new API service used to register new seats for a bidder. This can be done manually through post calls to the API or done in real time when a bidder bids with a new seat id in the bid response.

## Summary

Seat Service is used to store a bidder's seat IDs. These seat IDs will be used in the bid response and logged in transaction reporting.
