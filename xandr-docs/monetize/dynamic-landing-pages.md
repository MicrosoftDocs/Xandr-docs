# Microsoft Monetize - Dynamic landing pages

As an advertiser, you may wish to send users to different landing pages or compare the performance of different landing pages. To accomplish this, you can associate a landing page URL with a line item or campaign. This landing page will then be available for association with any creatives that are attached to that line item or campaign.

You can still attach a landing page URL at the creative level. However, if you select the **Set a landing page at the line item or campaign level** radio button on the
**Create New** screen, you will only be able to associate the landing page URL at that level. If the **Set a landing page at the line item or campaign level** radio button is selected and there is no landing page URL at the line item or campaign level, the creative will not serve.

> [!NOTE]
> All landing page URLs must have `https://` included in the URL string. For example, `https://www.``appnexus``.com` is a valid landing page URL. Excluding `https://` from the URL string may result in errors.
