# Page Properties Targeting



Through page properties targeting, you can target impressions based on
the position of the creative tag on the page or based on values passed
in the query string of the ad call.



<b>Important:</b> Since sellers pass tag
position and query strings, these targeting options are therefore most
often used when buying direct inventory.



1.  In the Targeting section of your
    line item or campaign, click the pencil icon
    in the Page Properties row.
    1.  The Page Properties Targeting
        dialog displays.
2.  Select checkboxes for the specific creative tag positions that you
    wish target (all tag positions are targeted by default):
    - Above the Fold - the top half of
      the page
    - Below the Fold - the bottom half
      of the page
    - Unknown - undetermined location
      on the page
3.  Click the toggle to enable query-string targeting (all query strings
    are targeted by default).
    1.  Choose to Include or
        Exclude either
        all or
        any of the query strings you
        wish to declare.
    2.  Enter valid a query string into the text box.
    3.  Click +Add Another String to
        additional query strings. Repeat this step as many times as is
        necessary.
4.  Click Save.
