# Best Practices



Below are a set of best practices Xandr requires
Supply Partners to abide by to be in good standing and to have access to
the open exchange. Xandr reserves the right to
disable Supply Partners in whole or in part, including shutting off
access to the open exchange, if they do not abide by these best
practices.



## Integration Health

To access the RTB exchange, Supply Partners must:

- Integrate with the latest version of OpenRTB (currently 2.4 or higher)
  as implemented by Xandr
- Abide by Xandr's requirements for specific
  devices & formats across channels





## Inventory Standards

To sell inventory on the open exchange, Supply Partners must provide
information that validates that they are approved to monetize a
Publisher's inventory. By cooperating with this
validation, Xandr and our Supply Partners are
taking a stand against the arbitrage of Publisher inventory, building
trust through transparency with buyers and sellers alike.

To this end, the following best practices must be followed to sell
Publisher inventory as a Xandr Supply Partner:

- Maintain direct relationships with the owner of the inventory's
  underlying domain or app. No third party or network traffic should be
  uploaded.
- Create a properly labeled, separate Publisher object for each
  Publisher. Each Publisher object should represent the business entity
  with whom the Supply Partner holds the end financial relationship.
- Disclose Publisher details in keeping with
  Xandr Inventory Relationship Declaration
  requirements.
- Ensure that domains with `ads.txt` files, or applications with
  `app-ads.txt` files associated, list you as an authorized reseller.
  Guidance for how Supply Partners can work with their partners to
  declare their Xandr members in
  `ads.txt/app-ads.txt` files can be found in <a

  class="xref" target="_blank">Support for Ads.txt and App-Ads.txt</a>.





## Transparent Auctions

Supply Partners must hold a fair and transparent auction in which
auction manipulation is prohibited, which includes but is not limited to
non-transparent fees and dynamic flooring.





## Build to our APIs

To access Xandr's platform, supply partners must
use our APIs. All system objects should be created and managed via
<a href="https://docs.xandr.com/bundle/xandr-api/page/welcome.html"
class="xref" target="_blank">APIs</a>. Any Supply Partner who wishes to
sell Deals must do so via the
<a href="https://docs.xandr.com/bundle/xandr-api/page/deal-service.html"
class="xref" target="_blank">Deal Service</a>.
