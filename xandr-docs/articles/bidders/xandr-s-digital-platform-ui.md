# Xandr's Digital Platform UI



Some advertisers may not have their own real-time optimization engine or
may not desire to build a bidder from scratch. These advertisers can use
Xandr's Digital Platform UI (formerly known as
AppNexus Console) to buy inventory on the
Xandr platform. The Digital Platform UI is an
independent bidder and optimization engine, with a web-based as well as
an API-based interface, operationally maintained by
Xandr. If you are interested in the Digital
Platform UI, please contact your Xandr
representative.
