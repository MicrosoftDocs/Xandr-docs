# Data Marketplace - Data Partner Overview

<div class="body">

Buyers on the <span class="ph">Xandr</span> platform often use
third-party data made available by our data providers to target
particular audience or inventory in their campaigns.
<span class="ph">Xandr</span> now supports the clearing of fees and
charges associated with the purchase of third-party data so that you can
avoid having to invoice individual buyers for these changes.
Instead, <span class="ph">Xandr</span> can directly invoice these buyers
for those fees on your behalf.

<span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Only data providers who have
executed the <span class="ph">Xandr</span> Data Provider agreement with
<span class="ph">Xandr</span> and have provided pricing are eligible to
have the fees cleared by <span class="ph">Xandr</span>.
