# Toggle PSAs on Android

PSAs (Public Service Announcements) are ads that can be served as a last
resort, if there are no other ads to show.

They are not enabled by default, but you can turn them on using the code
shown below.

Turn on PSAs with the following code:

``` 
// Whether the ad view should show PSAs if there are no ads to
// show.
adView.setShouldServePSAs(true);
    
```
