# June 17, 2025 - Updates to Native Assembly

An enhancement to Native Assembly creation process now includes the ability to select the Adaptive renderer or create a custom renderer, to search and filter placements you want to associate to the renderer, and to enable server-side Native Assembly right from the renderer experience.
