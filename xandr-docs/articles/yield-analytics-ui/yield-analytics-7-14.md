## Find products

- Additional Metrics are now configurable, which includes metrics that
we have previously shown as meta data. The reasoning is that
Services/Clients find that data helpful when exporting.
- Export will only export what is currently shown in the table, and
not all meta data - as was done previously. The new mechanism is
consistent with Reports, where what you see in the table is what is
exported. The format for the export on the Find Products page is now
consistent with the export format for Reports.
- The look and feel is nearly identical to Reports. This is also for
consistency.
- The selection of a product behaves the same as the Reports page i.e.
a dialog is launched where meta data, characteristics, product group can
be viewed, as well as permissioned buttons to navigate to other
locations.

## New landing page for find

- You can add Additional Metrics.
