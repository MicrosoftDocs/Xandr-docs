# Microsoft Monetize - Create an impression tracker

Impression trackers are used to track user impressions on creatives served by off-platform (non-Xandr) ad servers.

This document describes how to create an impression tracker and export it for use with creatives served by an external ad server. Most ad servers allow you to attach a "piggyback pixel" to a creative when you upload it. The impression tracker is meant to be uploaded as a piggyback pixel so that when that creative loads, the impression tracker will load as well and let Xandr know that an impression took place.

## Step 1. Create an impression tracker

1. Navigate to the **Impression Trackers** screen (**Advertisers** > **Impression Trackers**) and select an appropriate advertiser if prompted.

1. On the **Impression Trackers** screen, click **+ New** to open the **Create New Impression Tracker** dialog.

1. In the **Imp Tracker Details** section, enter the name of the impression tracker. You can click **Advanced Options** if you'd like to assign your own custom code to this impression tracker.

## Step 2. Associate with a line item (required)

Impression trackers are associated with line items. Under the **Line Item Association** section, click **Edit** to choose the line item you'd like to associate this impression tracker with. You can also search for a line item.

> [!NOTE]
> Once a line item is associated with an impression tracker, you can report on the impressions coming through that tracker. You can separate impression and click trackers by grouping by **Impression Type** in [Network Reporting](network-reporting.md) or [Publisher Reporting](publisher-reporting.md).

## Step 3. Associate with a publisher (required)

Under **Publisher Settings**, click **Edit** and choose the publisher you'd like to associate this impression tracker with.

## Step 4. Associate with a placement (optional)

You can associate your impression tracker with a placement. This allows you to report on the impressions coming through a placement, for example with the [Seller Site Domain Report](seller-site-domain-report.md).

## Step 5. Associate with a payment rule (optional)

Because you are required to associate your impression tracker with a publisher, you can optionally associate it with a payment rule as well. For more information about payment rules, see [Create Payment Rules](create-payment-rules.md).

## Step 6. Export the impression tracker

Finally, export the impression tracker by clicking the checkbox to its left, and selecting **More Actions** > **Export tags** from the menu to the right of the **Create Imp Tracker** button.

The **Export Trackers** dialog will appear. Under **Basic Options**, you can choose to export a JavaScript tag or a secure pixel.

Under **Delivery Options**, you can choose to generate the tags now, or have them sent to you in an email.

The **Advanced Options** section presents several different macros that you can use to populate your impression tracker. For more information about these macros, see [Creative Macros](creative-macros.md).

## Step 7. Add macro parameters (optional)

The exported impression tracker will look something like the following (this tracker includes placeholders for the macros `CACHEBUSTER`, `ANCOST`, and `REDIRECT_URL` from the **Advanced Options** section of the export dialog shown above).

``` 
<!-- Imp Tracker DO NOT MODIFY --> <img src="media/imptr?id=2766&cachebuster=[CACHEBUSTER]&ancost=[ANCOST]&t=2&redir=[REDIRECT_URL]" width="1" height="1" /> <!-- End of Imp Tracker --> 
```

The table below lists the parameters you can add to the impression tracker and their definitions.

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `ancost` | Passes Xandr the media cost. This should be populated with what you paid for the impression in the original system. <br><br> **Note**: This will override any payment rules. |
| `cachebuster` | Cachebusters ensure that the user's browser does not cache the URL. It should be dynamically generated by the ad server from which the impression originates. |
| `redir` | The URL you'd like the creative to redirect to. This will supersede any redirect value entered into Monetize. <br><br> **Note**: This parameter must be placed at the end of the query string. If it's anywhere else in the query string, the redirect will not be successful. |
