# Create a Native Assembly



You can easily modify native assemblies that contain pre-configured
native creative asset specifications or create your own from scratch.



1.  Select a pre-configured native assembly or
    create your own by doing one of the following:
    - Click the Select button from one
      of the corresponding pre-configured assemblies.
      

      Note: We offer a variety of
      pre-configured native assembly types such as carousel and video.
      You can filter by creative asset specification to find a specific
      pre-configured native assembly.

      
    - Click the Select button from the
      Create From Scratch tile.

    

    The Native
    Assembly \> Setup
    screen displays.

    
2.  Enter a new name for the native
    assembly.
3.  Associate placements with the native assembly
    by doing the following:
    1.  If you would like to search for and
        associate placements under a specific publisher, select the
        Filter placements by publisher
        checkbox.
        

        If you would like to search for and associate placements across
        multiple publishers, leave the Filter
        placements by publisher checkbox deselected and proceed
        to substep **d**.

        
    2.  Enter a publisher in the
        Select a publisher to filter
        placement options search field.
    3.  Select the corresponding publisher from the
        search results that display.
        

        Only placements that are available for these specific publishers
        will display when searching and associating placements. You must
        associate the native assembly to a placement in order for it to
        go live. For more information, see
        <a href="create-a-placement.html" class="xref">Create a Placement</a>.

        
    4.  Enter a placement name or ID in the
        Choose placements search
        field.
        

        Search results will automatically display.

        
    5.  Select any of the checkboxes for the
        corresponding placements that display.
        

        The selected placements will display under the
        Choose placements search
        field.

        
    6.  Enter a Main
        Image Floor Price for each placement if
        applicable.
    7.  Enter a Video
        Floor Price for each placement if applicable.

    

    For more information about floor prices, see
    <a href="floor-prices.html" class="xref"
    title="A floor price is the minimum net bid price that a seller is willing to accept for a bid in an auction. To win an auction that has a set floor price, the buyer&#39;s bid must be greater than or equal to the floor price.">Floor
    Prices</a> and
    <a href="deal-auction-mechanics.html" class="xref">Deal Auction
    Mechanics</a>.

    
4.  Click the Additional
    Specifications menu in the
    Creative Asset Specifications
    section to add and configure creative asset specifications for the
    native assembly.
    

    

    Warning: For the best
    Xandr marketplace performance, third-party
    ad server publishers should refrain from adding video assets and any
    custom native assets to their native assemblies.

    

    

    

    All pre-configured native assemblies contain preset creative asset
    specifications. Although these are recommended configurations, they
    can be modified. For example, if you want to only serve creatives
    that contain a particular asset specification, set it to
    Required, which may limit your
    demand. Otherwise, set the creative asset specification to
    Optional. You can also remove any
    creative asset specification at any time by clicking the
    X.

    

    

    

    Note: If you remove a creative
    asset specification, the HTML code on the
    Renderer tab won't automatically
    reflect this change, so you'll have to manually remove the
    corresponding HTML from the HTML
    text box.

    

    
5.  Click the
    Renderer tab to add or update the
    HTML, CSS, and Javascript in the designated text boxes.
    

    To ensure that you're following our native assembly renderer best
    practices, see
    <a href="native-assembly-renderer-best-practices.html" class="xref"
    title="The Renderer tab stores the HTML, CSS, and Javascript code associated with the native assembly. Any changes made on the Renderer tab will automatically be reflected in the Preview window.">Native
    Assembly Renderer Best Practices</a>.

    
6.  Use the
    Preview window on the right to
    ensure that no additional changes are needed.
7.  Use the Preview
    Settings to:
    - resize the Preview window.
      

      Note: Changing the
      Preview window size doesn't
      affect the renderer code.

      
    - specify which asset specifications should appear in the
      Preview window by clicking
      one of the following buttons if you've selected the video and
      image asset specifications from the
      Creative Asset
      Specifications section:
      - Video and Text: Only the
        sample video and text, such as the title, will display in the
        Preview window when this
        button is selected.
      - Main Image and Text: Only the
        sample main image and text, such as the title, will display in
        the Preview window when
        this button is selected.
      - Text Only: Only sample text,
        such as the title, will display in the
        Preview window when this
        button is selected.
      - All: All sample assets (video,
        main image, and any text) will display in the
        Preview window when this
        button is selected.
    - specify whether the AdChoices icon should appear in the
      Preview window by clicking
      one of the following buttons from the
      Privacy URL Specifications
      subsection:
      - With Privacy URL: The
        AdChoices icon will be appended to the creative in the
        Preview window when this
        button is selected.
      - Without Privacy URL: The
        AdChoices icon won't be appended to the creative in the
        Preview window when this
        button is selected.

    

    

    Note: Since various combinations of
    native assets can serve on the same placement when using a flexible
    renderer, it's important to preview your asset specifications to see
    how the renderer will handle your placements and native assets.

    

    
8.  Do one of the following:
    1.  Save all changes by clicking the
        Save button.
    2.  Save all changes and duplicate the native
        assembly by clicking the arrow next to the
        Save button and clicking
        Save and duplicate.

    

    The native assembly is now available from the
    Native Assembly Gallery screen. If
    you've duplicated the native assembly, the current screen refreshes
    so that you can make the necessary updates. Use steps 2 - 7 outlined
    above to make the necessary updates.
