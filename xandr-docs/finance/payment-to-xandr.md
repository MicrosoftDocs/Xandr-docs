# Finance - Payment

## Microsoft Advertising invoice information

Microsoft Advertising invoices are sent within 5 business days
of the end of the previous month of service; for example, for March
purchase of media the invoice date would be no later than April 7 (at
the latest).

Payment terms are typically net 30 from the date of invoice. Refer to
your contract for further information on your payment terms.

For general information on your invoice, see [Understanding
your Invoice](understanding-your-invoice.md).

## Payment instructions

Refer to the specific payment instructions on your invoice for the most

## Billing reports in the UI

You can get billing reports broken out by time period, inventory source,
advertisers and publishers (for networks) and many other metrics.
Billing reports are available through the UI and the API.
