# Planner



Planner is an interactive forecasting tool that provides reach and
delivery projections in real time. Planner helps you understand the
delivery and reach opportunities for a curated
deal before constructing a deal line
item, adjusting your strategy as you go based on direct visual and
statistical feedback.

For example, you can compare the projected reach in different zip codes,
predict availability across video channels, or identify the
highest-value user segments, based on real user and impression data
across the Xandr platform. Planner also
recommends the best-performing inventory based on your targeting
preferences. When you've adjusted the plan to maximize your goals, you
can share targeting and supply data with your team, and seamlessly
create a deal line item based on your plan.





<b>Note:</b> Planner forecasts rely on
historical data that is collected over time. For the most accurate
results, audiences should be onboarded and deals should be live for a
week before you create projections with Planner.
