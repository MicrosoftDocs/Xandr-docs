# Working with Third-Party Buying Filters



There are literally billions of chances for buyers to purchase
impressions every single day. However, this is never done; buyers have
finite budgets and must choose the web sites on which they want their
ads to run with great care. In addition to campaign-specific
specifications, buyers can also create filters that govern all of their
campaigns. These filters cover two areas:

- Including or excluding specific domain lists
- Including specific countries

You can create these filters in Microsoft Monetize
by going to the menu location
Network 
\>  Tools  \>
 General. Select the
3rd-Party Buying Filters tab.



<b>Note:</b> These settings affect third-party
inventory only. They have no impact on managed inventory.



Manage Your Third-Party Buying Filters

This 3rd-Party Buying Filters screen shows the two areas in which you
can apply member-wide filters.

Location

To reach this screen, select
Network 
\>  Tools  \>
 General on the top menu and
then select the 3rd-Party Buying
Filters tab.

Targeting: Geography

This section allows you to establish a list of countries that you can
choose from when targeting a specific campaign.

- **Search:** You can enter a text string in this field (to the right of
  the magnifying glass symbol) to locate a country in the **Available
  List**. As you type, countries matching the entered text appear in the
  field.
- **Available List:** This section contains the countries that you have
  not yet selected.
- **Chosen List:** This section contains the countries that you have
  selected. Only these countries will be available for campaign
  targeting by geography (refer to
  <a href="geography-targeting.md" class="xref">Geography Targeting</a>
  for more information).

Inventory: Domain Lists

This section allows you to determine targeting using domain lists.

- **Search:** You can enter a text string in this field (to the right of
  the magnifying glass symbol) to locate a country in the Available
  Domains List.
- **Available Domain Lists:** This section contains the lists that you
  have not yet selected.
- **Chosen Domain Lists:** This section contains the lists that you have
  selected. Depending on your selection for the **Include/Exclude
  specific list of domains** (above), the domains in these lists will
  either be restricted from bidding, or will be the only domains in
  which you can bid.

Limit the Countries That You Can Target

The first section of the 3rd-Party Buying
Filters section allow the creation of a list of countries. These
countries will be the only locations in which your campaigns will be
able to purchase third-party impressions. This allows you to be more
efficient when creating campaigns because you will have a smaller list
of countries from which to define geographic targeting.

Step 1. Open the Targeting: Geography section

Click the arrow to the left of the **Targeting: Geography** header. The
section opens to allow for editing.

Prior to opening this section, the countries which have already been
included for this member are visible. This information is visible below
the title of the collapsed section.

Step 2. Choose the countries to add or remove from targeting

You can move countries between the **Available List** and the **Chosen
List** to include or exclude them from targeting. Countries that appear
in the **Chosen List** are eligible for third-party targeting when
creating a campaign. Countries that appear in the **Available List**
cannot be selected when creating a campaign.

**To move countries to the Chosen List:**

A country must be highlighted in the **Available List** before you can
move it to the **Chosen List**. There are several ways to highlight and
move countries:

- Click on the desired country or countries select the
  Add button at the bottom of the
  list. All highlighted countries move to the **Chosen List**.
- Type the country name in the search field (to the right of the
  magnifying glass symbol). The list shows only those countries that
  match your search criteria. Highlight the desired countries and click
  the Add button at the bottom of the
  list. All highlighted countries move to the **Chosen List**.
- Click the Select all option at the
  top right of the list. Click the Add
  button at the bottom of the list to move them all to the **Chosen
  List**.

**To move countries to the Available List:**

A country must be highlighted in the **Chosen List** before you can move
it to the **Available List**. The options for highlighting and moving
countries to this list are the same as moving them to the **Chosen
List** (with the exception that all movement is in the reverse
direction).

Step 3. Save your settings

Click the Save button at the bottom
left of the screen when you have finished making changes to the
**Targeting: Geography** settings.



<b>Important:</b> Saving the **Targeting:
Geography** settings does not preclude you from making changes to the
**Inventory: Domain List** settings.



Limit the Domain Lists That You Can Target

The second section of the 3rd Party Buying
Filters screen allows you to choose which domain lists you will
use, either inclusively or exclusively.

Step 1. Open the Inventory: Domain Lists Section

Click the arrow to the left of the **Targeting: Geography** header. The
section opens to allow for editing.



<b>Important:</b> This section shows the
domain lists which have already been included for this member prior to
opening it. These are seen to the right of the **Include** text in the
second row of the collapsed section.



Step 2. Indicate whether to specify domain lists or not

This option allows you to choose one or more domain lists at the network
level, thereby filtering the websites they contain prior to use for
targeting at the campaign level. This is beneficial if you know that you
regularly include or exclude one or more domains. You must choose one of
the following options:

**Include all domains:** Select this option to keep all domain lists
available for targeting at the campaign level. You would select this if
you do not have any "across-the-board" inclusions or exclusions and want
all domain lists available when you specify campaign-level targeting.

**Include/Exclude specific list of domains:** Select this option to
specify network-wide inclusions and exclusions by domain list. When you
select this option, you are presented with all domain lists in the
Available Domain Lists field. You must
move the desired domain lists into the
Targeted Domain Lists field and
determine whether to **Include** or
Exclude them.

- **Exclude:** Choose this option to ensure that this domain list will
  **not** be available for targeting at the campaign level once you move
  it to the **Targeted Domain List**. This means that you will not be
  able to use it at the campaign level. However, this makes all other
  domains included by default.
- **Include:** Inclusion at the network level restricts the **domains**
  that are available to be targeted at the campaign level. At the
  campaign level, you can include additional domain lists, even though
  they were not included at the network level. However, if those domain
  lists contain domains which are not part of the domain lists included
  at the network level, those domains will not be targeted.

**Common Use Cases**

1.  If you have domains that you wish to exclude from seeing impressions
    (a network wide blocklist), you should exclude the blocked domain
    list at the network level. This way, no campaigns will serve on the
    domains in this list since all blocked domains will be filtered out
    prior to applying the campaign level domain lists.
2.  If you have domains on which you always want to serve impressions (a
    network wide allowlist), you should include the allowed domain lists
    at the network level. This way, your campaigns will never serve on
    domains that have not been included in the allowlist since these
    domains will be filtered out prior to applying the campaign level
    domain lists.
3.  If you do not have a network wide blocklist or allowlist, then you
    should not use network level settings.

**Example:**

- You include two domain lists at the network level: **DLA** and
  **DLB**.
  - **DLA** contains domains **AAA.com**, **BBB.com**, **CCC.com**, and
    **DDD.com**.
  - **DLB** contains domains **111.com**, **222.com**, **333.com**, and
    **444.com**.
- These two domain lists and the eight domains pass through to the
  campaign level. At that time you can include or exclude either domain
  list on a campaign-by-campaign basis. In this example, we will include
  both at the campaign level.
- At the campaign level, you include domain list **DLA1**.
  - This domain lists contains the following domains: **AAA.com**,
    **CCC.com**, **222.com**, **777.com**, and **999.com**
- **DLA1** will be included with the campaign. Domains **AAA.com**,
  **CCC.com**, and **222.com** will be targeted, because they are
  contained within at least one of the domain lists included at the
  domain level (**DLA** and **DLB**). However, domains **777.com** and
  **999.com** will **not** be targeted, as they are not contained with
  either of the two domain lists included at the network level.



<b>Note:</b> Be sure to note the difference
between a **domain** and a **domain list** in the descriptions above.



Step 3. Choose the domain lists to add or remove from targeting

You can move domain lists between the **Available Domain Lists** and the
**Targeted Domain Lists** fields to make them available for targeting or
exclusion in a campaign. Domain lists that appear in the **Targeted
Domain Lists** are eligible for targeting when creating a campaign.
Domain lists that appear in the **Available Domains List** cannot be
selected when creating a campaign.

**To move countries to the Targeted Domain List:**

- Click the Add button at the bottom
  of the list. All highlighted countries move to the **Targeted Domains
  List**.
- Type the country name in the search field (to the right of the
  magnifying glass symbol). The list shows only those countries that
  match your search criteria. Highlight the desired countries and click
  the Add button at the bottom of the
  list. All highlighted countries move to the **Targeted Domains List**.
- Click the Select all option at the
  top right of the list. Click the Add
  button at the bottom of the list to move them all to the **Chosen
  Domains List**. Everything in the **Targeted Domain List** is
  available for use on the
  <a href="working-with-targeting-lists.md" class="xref">Working with
  Targeting Lists</a> screen.

**To move countries to the Available Domains List:**

- Click on the desired country or countries to highlight them and click
  the Remove button at the bottom of
  the list. All highlighted countries move to the **Available Domains
  List**.
- Type the country name in the search field (to the right of the
  magnifying glass symbol). The list shows only those countries that
  match your search criteria. Highlight the desired countries and click
  the Remove button at the bottom of
  the list. All highlighted countries move to the **Available Domains
  List**.
- Click the Select all option at the
  top right of the list. Click the
  Remove button at the bottom of the
  list to move them all to the **Available Domains List**.

Step 4. Save your settings

Click the Save button at the bottom
left of the screen when you have finished making changes to the
**Inventory: Domain List** settings.



<b>Important:</b> Saving these settings does
not close the section. You can save and then make changes to the
**Targeting: Geography** settings.
