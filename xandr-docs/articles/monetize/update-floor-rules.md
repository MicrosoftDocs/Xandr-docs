and offers bulk editing options.

## Getting to the floor rules screen

**Publisher-only clients:** Select **Partners** \> **Yield Management** \> **Floor rules** in the menu bar,
and then select a publisher if you are prompted.

**All other clients:** Select **Publishers** \> **Floor Rules** in the
menu bar, and then select a publisher if you are prompted.

## Viewing floor rule details

The grid at the top shows basic information about a floor rule, such as
its name and ID. To see more details about a rule, clicking anywhere in
the row except the checkbox. The **Rule

following:

- **Name**: The name that you provided for
  the rule.

- **Priority**: The rule's priority. Rules
  are checked against every impression in priority order.

- **Description**: Text description of the
  rule (optional).

- **Hard floor**: The hard floor set within
  the rule. This is the lowest price you will accept for this inventory.

- **Soft floor**: The soft floor set within
  the rule. This is the lowest price to which the winning bid will be
  reduced. (Not applicable if Floor Optimization is turned on.)

- **Floor Optimization**: Whether Floor
  Optimization is turned on or off. Floor Optimization programmatically
  sets a new floor for each impression. See [Floor Optimization](floor-optimization.md) for more information.

- **Floor Price Applies To**: The type of
  impressions, managed, third-party, or both, that the floor rule
  applies to.<br>For conditional floor rules, the targeting rules are also displayed.
