## How is FX margin applied?

- FX margin is only charged on non-USD media costs that Xandr clears.
  - For Buyers, this is any non-USD "Cost of Media" on the invoice.
  - For Sellers, this is any non-USD "Seller Revenue" on a payment.
- FX Margin is a percentage calculated by multiplying the FX Margin Rate % \* Media Cost.
- We will waive FX Margin when the buyer and seller billing currencies are equivalent (effective 2/1/2021).
- Margin can be charged as either a fee or deduction (both are described below in greater detail).

## Fee vs deduction

Xandr can charge FX Margin as either a fee or deduction (depending on what the client prefers). Generally, we apply whatever method is being used for the client's BASC/SASC charges (but that can be overridden as needed). Each charging method is described below:

| FX Margin as a Deduction | FX Margin as a Fee |
|--|--|
| A revenue sharing percentage, calculated by multiplying the FX Margin Rate % * Media Cost<br>Included in cost budget<br>Bid reduced<br>Rolled into media cost during billing, will appear as "Cost of Media" on the buyer's invoice.<br>Can be charged to both buyers and sellers depending on where the FX risk lies. | A revenue sharing percentage, calculated by multiplying the FX Margin Rate % * Media Cost<br>Not included in cost budget<br>Not bid reduced<br>Not included in media cost during billing, therefore appears as a separate line item on an invoice as "FX Margin Fee".<br>Can be charged to both buyers and sellers depending on where the FX risk lies. |

## Reconciliation

To reconcile the FX Margin charge that may be applied to you with your invoices, refer to the applicable section below.

## Buyers

Buyers can view either FX Margin Fees or Deductions in the Buying Billing Report in the UI. To view these values within that report,
select the applicable metric (e.g., FX Margin
Fee or FX Margin Deduction)
prior to running the report.

## Sellers

To protect contract terms privacy, Xandr does not expose sell-side revenue sharing in reporting.
