# Segment Targeting



You can target users within segments by using Boolean expressions. Users
get added to segments after they've viewed or clicked a particular
creative.

You can set up segment targeting by going to the
Audience &
Location Targeting \> Audience &
Location Segments subsection within the
Create New Line Item screen or
Edit Line Item screen. The
Audience & Location Segments
subsection displays all segments belonging to the advertiser for the
associated line item as well as segments defined at the
Member level.



## Creating Boolean Expressions Between Segment Groups and Segments



You can use the following Boolean operators to narrow or broaden your
targeting scope:
