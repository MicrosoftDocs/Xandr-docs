# Email in the Customer Support Portal



Log in to the
<a href="https://help.xandr.com" class="xref" target="_blank">Customer
Support Portal</a> to access your full case history, knowledge base
articles, or request support.

If you contacted support as a guest, without logging in to the portal,
you will only be able to communicate via email.

If anyone you've cc'd on a case would like a portal account, they can
visit
the <a href="https://help.xandr.com" class="xref" target="_blank">Login</a> page,
proceed as a Guest, and click Contact
Support.
