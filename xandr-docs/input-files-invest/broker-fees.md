# Broker Fees





<b>Important:</b> Broker fees are deprecated
on augmented line items and programmatic guaranteed line items. If you
wish to track a third-party fee for an ALI or PGLI, please use
<a href="partner-fees.md" class="xref">Partner Fees</a>.



You may see references to broker fees in some reports on historical data
as "commissions". For reports run on data from September 10, 2019 or
later, current commissions always equal $0.
