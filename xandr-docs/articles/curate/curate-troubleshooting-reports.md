# Troubleshooting Reports



**Troubleshooting Reports** provides you easy access to set up and run
reports that can help you troubleshoot deal line items. These reports
are simplified versions of the most common reports available. You can
use these reports to further investigate any issues surfaced in the
Impression Funnel section. For
more information, see
<a href="curate-impression-funnel.md" class="xref">Impression
Funnel</a>.

You can configure the following for each report you run:

>

- **Report Type** - use the drop-down to select the report you want to
  run. The following reports are available:
  - **Bid Error Report**
  - **Deal Metrics Report**
- **Buyer** - the deal buyers you’d like to filter the report by. Click
  the Edit icon to change deal buyers.
- **Time Range** - use the drop-down to select the time frame for the
  report. Choose from:
  - **10 Minutes**
  - **1 Hour**
  - **24 Hours**
- **Columns** - you can choose the dimensions and metrics you want in
  your report. To select or unselect dimensions and metrics:
  - Click Modify Columns to display
    the Modify Columns dialog.
  - Select the Dimensions or
    Metrics tab to list available
    columns in each.
  - Check any columns you want to add and uncheck any columns you want
    to remove.
  - Optionally, you can rearrange the columns by dragging and dropping
    them.
  - Click Save.
- **Run Report** - click Run Report to
  run the report and display the results.
- **Export to CSV** - when results are displayed, you can click
  Export to CSV to download the report
  as a .csv file.

There are couple of additional settings are available when you run a
deal metrics report. They are as follows:

- **Breakout Deals By** – you can breakout the metrics per DSP, buyer
  member, buyer seat, seller deal or split to get a more granular view
  of the activity occurring through your curated deal. For example, if
  you have issued your curated deal to multiple buyer seats, you can see
  the number of bids per seat; or if you target seller deals you can see
  the number of imps matched per seller deal.
- **Time Range** – how far back you would like to include data. For
  example, last 24 hours.
- **Time Interval** – how you would like to group the data. For example,
  by hour.
