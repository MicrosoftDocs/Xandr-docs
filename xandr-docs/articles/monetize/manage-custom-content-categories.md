# Manage custom content categories

Custom content categories allow you to apply a single label to a number of placement groups and/or placements. Buyers can then more easily research and buy your inventory. This area of Microsoft Monetize displays a working list of your custom content categories, allowing you to create buckets in which you can group your inventory. After you have created custom categories, publishers can assign placements to them. At that point, buyers can then choose these categories when defining the targeting settings of a campaign.

In the Content Categories area of Microsoft Monetize, you can perform the following tasks:

- Create a new custom content category
- Edit the name and description of an existing custom content category
- Delete a custom content category
