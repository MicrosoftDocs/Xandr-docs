## In this guide

- [Ad Buying with Xandr](ad-buying-with-xandr.md): The combination of market positioning and single-point
  access to programmatic buying features through
  Monetize add up to unparalleled advantages for
  ad buying.
- [Basic Buy-side Setup Procedures](basic-buy-side-setup-procedures.md): This overview walks through the
  essential procedures used to set up ad purchasing in
  Monetize.
- [Automatic Archiving of Buy-Side Objects](automatic-archiving-of-buy-side-objects.md): To avoid
  confusion and clutter, some buy-side objects are automatically moved
  to an archived state and removed from view.
- [Working with Advertisers](working-with-advertisers.md): The advertiser object is the top level of the
  buy-side hierarchy (Advertiser \> Line Items \>
  Campaigns). Before you can set up line items to define your
  financial agreement and then start running campaigns and serving
  creatives on behalf of an advertiser, you must set up the advertiser
  itself.
- [Working with Insertion Orders](working-with-insertion-orders.md):  Insertion orders offer an
  additional level of flexibility, letting you bucket line items and
  campaigns under an advertiser
  (**Advertiser**
   \>  **Insertion Order**  \>
   **Line Items**).
- [Working with Line Items](working-with-line-items.md): A line item defines your financial agreement with an
  advertiser, including how much the advertiser has allocated for you to
  spend (budget), the basis on which the advertiser has agreed to pay
  you (revenue type), and performance requirements the advertiser
  expects you to meet (advertiser goals).
- [Working with Programmable Splits](working-with-programmable-splits.md): Programmable splits let you automate ad
  targeting using rulesets to ensure your ads are delivered and your
  budget is allocated to very specific segments.
- [Working with Campaigns](working-with-campaigns.md): If you use standard line items, you can set up
  campaigns to buy media based on your agreement. Setting up a campaign
  involves defining how much you are willing to spend (media budget),
  whether you want to buy both direct, third-party, or both types of
  inventory, how you want to bid (buying strategies), and how you want
  to target inventory and users.
  ([Augmented Line Items (ALI)](augmented-line-items-ali.md) include this information, so separate campaigns aren't
  needed.)
- [Buy-Side Targeting](buy-side-targeting.md):
  You can apply a wide range of targeting strategies to line items or
  campaigns. These strategies are essential for ensuring a return on
  your ad spending by making sure you reach relevant audiences.
- [Budgeting and Pacing](budgeting-and-pacing.md): Budgeting allows you to determine how much money you will
  earn or spend, while Pacing allows you to control the frequency with
  which the system attempts to win impressions in order to spend a
  budget as evenly as possible across a defined time period.
- [Working with Creatives](working-with-creatives.md): The Xandr platform enables
  you to traffic a wide range of creative types in your campaigns, from
  banners to pops to increasingly pervasive rich media types like
  interstitials, expandables, and videos. By hosting your creatives with
  us, you can take full advantage of the platform's full-service ad
  server capabilities built specifically for the real-time advertising
  business. Xandr makes it easy for you to
  traffic creatives that are served by third-party ad servers as well.
- [Working with Segments](working-with-segments.md): Segment pixels use information about a user, such as
  webpages they visit, actions they take, or qualities such as gender,
  location, and wealth, to assign that user to a group called a segment
  for future targeting.
- [Working with Conversion Pixels](working-with-conversion-pixels.md): Conversion pixels are used to track user
  actions in response to advertisers' creatives, such as registering at
  a site or making a purchase. When a conversion pixel fires,
  Xandr determines if the conversion (the
  registration, the purchase, etc.) can be "attributed", or tied to the
  user clicking on or viewing one of the advertiser's creatives
  previously.
- [Working with Impression and Click Trackers](working-with-impression-and-click-trackers.md):
  Impression and click trackers are used to track impressions and clicks
  associated with creatives that are hosted by off-platform
  (non-Xandr) ad servers. This is done by
  attaching the tracker as a "piggyback pixel" on the externally hosted
  creative. This lets you report on impressions and clicks on these
  creatives as if they were hosted by Xandr.
- [Create a User](create-a-user.md): You can
  create advertiser users for advertisers that want to run reports for
  themselves. An advertiser user does not see data about any other
  advertisers and does not have editing capabilities.
- [APAC Supply Information - Platform Inventory by Seller](apac-supply-information-platform-inventory-by-seller.md)
- [Working with Trader Home](working-with-trader-home.md)
- [Welcome to Mobile](welcome-to-mobile.md):
  Advertising on mobile devices is mostly similar to traditional display
  advertising (and where it differs, we'll explain those differences).
  This section is designed to provide you with a solid understanding of
  how advertising works on mobile devices.
- [Introduction to Viewability](introduction-to-viewability.md): Understand how Xandr measures
  ad views, and optimize the chances of your audience viewing your
  creatives.
- [Buying Video Inventory](buying-video-inventory.md): This guide provides advanced video reference
  information as well as information about buying in-stream, out-stream,
  and ConnectedTV inventory.
- [Buying Audio Inventory](buying-audio-inventory.md): This guide provides information about buying
  audio inventory.
- [Buying Microsoft Inventory](buying-microsoft-inventory.md): This guide provides information about buying inventory
  on multiple Microsoft properties, including MSN, Outlook, and Windows.
- [Buying Native Inventory](buying-native-inventory.md): Websites that sell native inventory accept ad content
  but enforce their own display properties to integrate. This guide
  describes how to buy native inventory on properties that allow it.
- [Native Inventory Seller Specifications](native-inventory-seller-specifications.md): Buying native
  inventory requires understanding detailed seller requirements.
- [Campaign Monitor](campaign-monitor.md): The
  Campaign Monitor allows you to quickly view which line items and
  campaigns are on track for performance and delivery and which may need
  a little more attention to get back on track.
- [Guaranteed Delivery](guaranteed-delivery.md):
  For direct-sold business, where sales has secured an insertion order
  from a buyer with a committed impression volume, the most important
  performance indicator is that the line item delivers its budget in
  full and evenly across its flight dates.
- [Data Marketplace Overview](data-marketplace-overview.md): Xandr supports automatic clearing of third-party segment data you can
  purchase and use to target audience segments.
