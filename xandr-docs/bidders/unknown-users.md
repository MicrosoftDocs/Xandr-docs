# Unknown users

The **Allow Unknown Users** toggle allows you to select if you want to receive traffic from unknown users. These are users for which we do not have a cookie ID or an allowed third party identifier (e.g. UID, RampID, Publisher Provided IDs, etc.).

> [!NOTE]
> By default, all users are allowed. If Allow Unknown Users is disabled, only inventory for users that exist in segments owned by your bidder or shared with your bidder will be allowed.
