<span class="ph">Xandr</span> facilitates the transmission of data
between data providers and data buyers on the platform. Our technical
team will help data providers integrate with the platform and assist
purchasers in using the data they have purchased.

This documentation contains information for data providers on the
processes and options for integrating data, sharing data with a buyer,
and maintaining data on the platform. While
<span class="ph">Xandr</span> does not currently operate a data
marketplace, it is a platform that supports its clients' use of
third-party data to enhance the performance of their campaigns. It is
not our objective to sell, arbitrate, or promote any data providers to
our existing clients.

<span class="ph">Xandr</span> serves as a facilitator and filter for our
clients if and when they decide to use additional user-centric or
inventory-based data to better target campaigns.
