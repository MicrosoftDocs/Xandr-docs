# Anatomy of Forecast Visibility page

The Forecast Visibility page on the **Capacity** tab shows a forecast of how a product's impressions will be consumed. It's displayed when you select a product in the **Impression Capacity** widget, or when you select a product on the **Forecast Management** page and select **View** > **Forecast Visibility**.

## Forecast Visibility interface

There are four sections on the **Forecast Visibility** page:

- **Product Detail** – Displays the product that's being forecasted. Select **Show Product Details** to view additional information.
- **Configuration panel** – Used to export the forecast, change the display from a chart to tabular data, and adjust the time period.
- **Capacity Forecast** – Displays your baseline/seasonal forecast, which includes holidays.
- **Adjustments Influencing Forecast** – Add or edit a manual or seasonal adjustment.
