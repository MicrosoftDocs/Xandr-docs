# Set Up Conversions with Universal Pixel



You can set up conversions for your universal pixel using rules and
conditions, then track conversion activity using
Monetize reporting.







1.  From the top menu bar, click
    Advertisers
    \> Universal Pixel 
2.  Select a pixel from the
    Universal Pixels page.
    

    If no pixels are defined, use the setup instructions in
    <a href="universal-pixel-basic-implementation.html" class="xref"
    title="With the most basic implementation of the universal pixel, you can track page views and identify the URLs driving them. Setting up the basic implementation requires you to set up the Universal Pixel object in Monetize, deploy the script code containing the pixel ID on your website, and check your pixel activity on the Activity tab in the Universal Pixels page.">Universal
    Pixel Basic Implementation</a> to create one.

    
3.  Click
    +New.
4.  Provide a name for the conversion. 
    

    This name will identify the conversion in conversion reporting.

    
5.  Categorize your conversion as a lead, landing
    page, or another event category. 
    

    <div id="set-up-conversions__note_pl3_qh3_tsb"
    

    Note: If you have already used a
    standard event as a condition for the conversion, then the
    conversion will be categorized with that standard event by default.

    

    
6.  Under
    Lookback, specify the time between
    an ad view or click and the conversion event during which you will
    attribute conversions to the ad view or click. 
    <div class="itemgroup stepxmp">

    For example, if you want to attribute any shopping cart adds that
    occurred in the month after viewing an ad to the ad view event, set
    the post view lookback to 31 days.

    
7.  Under Count,
    determine if you will limit the number of attributed conversions per
    user. You can also limit the number of conversions counted within a
    period of time. 
    <div class="itemgroup stepxmp">

    For example, you probably want to attribute multiple purchases per
    user within a time window to the ad, but if your conversion event is
    a page view for an informational site, counting multiple views might
    not be meaningful.

    
8.  Click
    Save.
