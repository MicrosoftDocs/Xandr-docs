# Default PSAs



Default public service announcement creatives (PSAs or PSA creatives)
are actual PSAs that Xandr serves in order to
prevent serving blanks under certain circumstances.



<b>Tip:</b> It is a best practice to set up a
default creative for each placement so that a PSA does not serve. For
more information, see

<b>Note:</b>

**About Flagged Impressions**

In the past, filtered impressions on inventory flagged as violating
platform standards would serve blanks. Now, these impressions follow
seller preferences for impressions with no demand. As with all
impressions that follow this workflow, sellers will be charged the
applicable fee.



Default PSAs are ads intended for general audiences that
Xandr serves for various causes and nonprofit
organizations at no cost in order to prevent serving a blank when there
is no other creative to serve.

Example PSAs

Below are a few examples of default PSAs served for managed inventory.

A PSA creative provided by Xandr will be served
for your managed inventory in the following circumstances:

- The impression is not purchased through a campaign

- No bid meets your reserve price

- No default creative is available

  We have PSAs for all standard placement sizes. If the placement tag is
  an unusual size for which we don't have a PSA, a blank will be served.

Report on PSAs

In network reporting, PSAs will show up as a buyer in a report grouped
by buyer. The buyer member associated with Xandr
default PSAs is ID 229, Public Service Announcements, but the report
will show a row for Buyer: PSA, and will not include Buyer 229.

Avoid Showing PSAs

To avoid showing PSAs, you can do the following:

- Make sure that your inventory is being targeted successfully by one or
  more campaigns. You may wish to review frequency caps, budget, and
  category/placement group/placement targeting to make sure they are not
  limiting the purchase of your direct inventory.

  impression is not purchased.
