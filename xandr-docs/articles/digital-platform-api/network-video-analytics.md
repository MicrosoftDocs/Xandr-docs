## Example

### Create JSON formatted report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` of `"video_analytics_network"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the format in which the data should be returned (`csv`, `excel`, or `html`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md).

```
$ cat video_analytics_network

{
    "report":
    {
        "report_type":"video_analytics_network",
        "columns":[
            "hour",
            "seller_member_id",
            "buyer_member_id",
            "advertiser_id",
            "publisher_id",
            "imps",
            "ad_requests",
            "ad_responses",
            "25_pcts",
            "completions",
            "completion_rate",
            "convs_rate"
        ],
        "report_interval":"last_48_hours",
        "format":"csv"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the reporting service

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @video_analytics_network 'https://api.appnexus.com/report'
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"097f59fc3ab7d02c5d60db42081d9b69"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service

Make a `GET` call with the report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the reporting data to a file (described in the next step).

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=097f59fc3ab7d02c5d60db42081d9b69'
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the Report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and Report ID in the `url` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!NOTE]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
