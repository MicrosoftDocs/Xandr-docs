# Inventory Standards and Auditing



Xandr devotes significant resources toward
safety and quality on both sides of transactions taking place on our
platform.

Buyers on our platform may submit their creatives for human auditing by
the Xandr audit team. The manual audit process
includes checking technical and content criteria as well as offer type
categorization to enable the seller protection features on the platform.
Buyers may self-audit their creatives, but because many sellers allow
only Xandr audited creatives, self-auditing may
reduce access to inventory outside of one's network.

Additionally, all creatives (including publisher default ad tags) on
Xandr's platform are continuously monitored for
overt malvertising threats and suspicious behavior regardless of audit
status. Our auditing technology also adds metadata to the creatives.

You can find more information about creative auditing in
<a href="creative-standards.md" class="xref"
title="Xandr has foundational policies that all creative and inventory content must follow. Creatives that violate these policies will be removed from the platform, and will be ineligible for both real-time bidding (RTB) and in-network buying. Repeated violation of these policies may result in strikes against offending members.">Creative
Standards</a>.

Similarly, Xandr monitors, both manually and
automatically, inventory sources available on our platform, and
blocklists URLs that do not meet platform standards. The
Xandr auditing team regularly audits new
inventory and reaudits existing inventory to apply categorization and
metadata at the domain level. This data can be leveraged on the demand
side to further target campaigns or to restrict delivery.



## Process and Procedure

For advertisers' safety, Xandr provides two
modes of inventory auditing.

First, we maintain a strict set of baseline criteria for excluding
unacceptable inventory from being sold over our platform. Any inventory
that we detect as falling within these criteria will be added to our
platform blocklist. We reject all requests made to our servers
originating from an inventory on our blocklist, including auction
requests, pixel calls and user syncing activities.

Second, inventory available on our platform may be tagged with content
categories, brand sensitive attributes, and intended audiences, either
by the Xandr audit team or by sellers.

- **Platform-Reviewed**: Xandr reviews a sub-set
  of domains available on our platform. Metadata is provided on a domain
  level, and is based on the referrer we receive from the browser, ad
  server, or aggregator.
- **Sellers**: Auditing may also be done by the network, aggregator, or
  exchange that represents the publisher.
  

  <b>Note:</b> While we believe that our
  audited domains are of a high quality, the nature of the internet is
  such that we cannot provide any guarantee regarding the nature or
  content of any inventory sold on the platform. For questions about
  this, or to report miscategorized inventory or inventory that should
  be banned under our blocklist criteria, contact us via
  <a href="https://help.xandr.com/" class="xref" target="_blank">Customer
  Support</a> and select "Inventory Quality" as the request type. (<b>Note:</b>
  client login required.)

  





## Standards

**Prohibited and Restricted Inventory**



<b>Note:</b> In the past, filtered impressions
on inventory flagged as violating platform standards would serve blanks.
Now, these impressions follow seller preferences for impressions with no
demand. As with all impressions that follow this workflow, sellers will
be charged the applicable fee.





<b>Important:</b> See the <a
href="https://microsoftapc.sharepoint.com/teams/XandrServicePolicies/SitePages/Policies-for-Selling.aspx"
class="xref" target="_blank">Policies for Selling</a> (login required)
for policies that apply globally on our platform.



Xandr works hard to create a safe and trusted ad
marketplace. We use various methods to continuously monitor traffic that
passes through our impression bus, whether it comes from
Xandr tags, white-labeled tags, or third-party
ad tags. This includes, but is not limited to, direct publisher
relationships and media buys placed with other ad servers, networks,
platforms and supply sources.

In applying content policies, we do not differentiate between inventory
that is monetized by the owning member or that is resold via the
platform.

Except for creatives banned by our
<a href="https://microsoftapc.sharepoint.com/teams/XandrServicePolicies"
class="xref" target="_blank">Service Policies</a> (login required),
networks may run any creatives on their own inventory regardless of
audit status (for more information, see
<a href="creative-standards.md" class="xref"
title="Xandr has foundational policies that all creative and inventory content must follow. Creatives that violate these policies will be removed from the platform, and will be ineligible for both real-time bidding (RTB) and in-network buying. Repeated violation of these policies may result in strikes against offending members.">Creative
Standards</a>). To allow this, under the Ad Quality manager for each
publisher, leave **"Ban unaudited creatives for direct advertisers"**
unchecked.

**Restricted Content**

In keeping with our inventory standards, there are categories of sites
that will not serve impressions. These categories are outlined clearly
in our Service Policies under Policies for Selling.

**Unauditable Inventory**

Domains listed as "unauditable" will be available for managed line
items, any buyers who set you as a "trusted partner", and those that
have not enabled inventory quality filtering.

- **Desktop apps and toolbars**: Sites whose purpose is the download of
  browser toolbars.

- **Automatic redirection to other sites**: Domains which automatically
  redirect to a different URL.

- **Website does not appear to function**: Sites that appear to be
  broken or have no content.

- **Website has no ads on page**: Sites that contain no visible ad
  units.

  To contest the audit status of a site, contact us via
  <a href="https://help.xandr.com/" class="xref" target="_blank">Customer
  Support</a> and select "Inventory Quality" as the request type. In the
  request, please detail your relationship with the publisher and add a
  brief description of why you believe the site has not been audited
  correctly. (<b>Note:</b> client login required.)





## Inventory Categorization Standards

**Sensitive Attributes**

These are qualities of a site or page that advertisers may wish to
exclude. We encourage all members to use these categories and
descriptions when self-classifying their own inventory.

- **Political**: Editorial content that is predominantly aimed at
  furthering the cause of any political party, organized campaign, or
  informal pressure group.
- **Social media**: A website platform primarily intended for
  independent publication by site users of personal thoughts and links,
  and interaction among its members.
- **Photo & video sharing**: Independent publication by site users of
  photographs and videos utilizing a tool provided by the site.
- **Forums (moderated)**: Online forums, comments areas, discussion
  groups, and newsgroups where people exchange ideas about a common
  interest, where the user's comments are subject to editorial control
  or moderation by a site publisher, or require the user to log in or
  supply personally identifying information like an email address.
  Moderation may occur either before or after the user's contribution is
  posted.
- **Forums (unmoderated)**: Sites or parts of sites primarily comprising
  forums, comment areas, discussion groups, and newsgroups not subject
  to any editorial control or moderation by or on behalf of the site
  publisher, and not requiring any login or identifying information from
  the user.
- **Incentivized clicks**: Sites or parts of sites containing content,
  such as links, to be clicked on by live users who subsequently receive
  some reward or incentive.
- **Non-English languages**: Sites where a significant portion of the
  text appears in a language other than English, and the site appears
  targeted to a non-English-speaking audience.
- **Streaming media**: Sites or parts of sites containing streaming
  music or embedded videos or flash games.
- **Toolbars, plug-ins or extensions**: Ad-supported browser plug-in
  inventory installed with user consent. More information on compliant
  toolbars can be found in our <a
  href="https://microsoftapc.sharepoint.com/teams/XandrServicePolicies/SitePages/Policies-for-Selling.aspx"
  class="xref" target="_blank">Policies for Selling</a> (login
  required).
- **Contextual nudity**: Non-sexual, non-vulgar nudity that appears as
  an incidental aspect of the site without being the focus of it.

**Intended Audience**

This category is used to indicate the age range of the target audience
for the content on the site. A site falls into "General audiences"
unless it contains content that is specifically targeted toward
children, young adults, or the 18+ category. (18+, also called "mature",
does not include so-called "adult content", i.e. pornography.)

- **Children**: A site or part of a site whose content is specifically
  targeted toward children. For special rules that apply to
  child-directed sites, see the Child-Directed Inventory Policy section
  of our <a
  href="https://microsoftapc.sharepoint.com/teams/XandrServicePolicies/SitePages/Policies-for-Selling.aspx"
  class="xref" target="_blank">Policies for Selling</a> (login
  required).
- **Young Adults**: A site or part of a site whose content is
  specifically targeted toward young adults.
- **General Audiences**: A site or part of a site which has no
  particular intended audience and whose content is appropriate for all
  ages.
- **Mature (18+)**: A site or part of a site whose content is not
  appropriate for children or young adults under 18.
