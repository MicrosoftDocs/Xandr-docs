# Microsoft Advertising customer support portal FAQs 

Frequently Asked Questions about Microsoft Advertising Customer Support Portal FAQs: 

## Why do I need to use the same email address for help.xandr.com and my Microsoft Invest, Microsoft Monetize, or Microsoft Curate accounts?

Previously, help.xandr.com allowed multiple emails to create cases for the same account. This is why you may have used a different email for help.xandr.com than the one linked to your Microsoft Invest, Microsoft Monetize, or Microsoft Curate accounts. Going forward, use the same email address you use to log in to your Monetize, Invest, or Curate accounts to create cases. This ensures our support team can respond to your requests more effectively.  

## How can I view cases created under a different email address?   

You can access cases created under a different email address by creating a personal Microsoft account using the old email address. While we discourage using this email to create new cases, you can use it to view previous cases. 

For example, if you logged into help.xandr.com with ABC@email.com but used XYZ@email.com for Microsoft Invest, create a personal Microsoft account with ABC@email.com as the username. Then, log into support.ads.microsoft.com using that account to view the old cases created under ABC@email.com. 

Going forward, use XYZ@email.com to create new cases in ads.microsoft.com.  

## What happens to the “Proceed as Guest” option for creating cases? 
The **Proceed as Guest** option is no longer available. To create a case, set up a personal Microsoft account and log in to the new Microsoft Advertising Customer Support Portal using that account. Once logged in, you can create a case through the portal.
