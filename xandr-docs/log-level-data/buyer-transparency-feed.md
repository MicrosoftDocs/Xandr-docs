# Buyer transparency feed

The Buyer Transparency Feed provides advertisers with the most granular insights about transactions that occurred on supply. Those insights include the bid that was submitted, the inventory that was sold, the auction that was run, as well as the tech fees and revenues that ended up with the exchange and the seller. The feed provides 28 datapoints for each impression that was served.

Currently, more than 60% of our direct seller transactions globally—and 85% in the US—are fee transparent.

For most auctions, there will be 1 row with all columns populated (fee columns will not be populated if the seller is not transparent). For Guaranteed Outcomes auctions, where the buyer is buying on an event basis (e.g., such as views or video completion), there can be 1 or 2 rows for the same auction. This will be determined by the following:

- For Guaranteed Outcomes auctions, where the buyer wins the auction and their creative is rendered, there will be 1 row that contains columns 1-10 (all columns).
- If the buyer’s required outcome (e.g., a view or complete) occurs, there will be another row that will include columns 1-7 and 10.

The Xandr internal name for this feed is `brand_transparency_feed`.
