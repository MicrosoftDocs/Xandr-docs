# Create a Partner Fee



You must have
<a href="getting-started-with-roles.md" class="xref">Network-level
access</a> to perform this task.

1.  Go to the Fees screen
    (Advertisers
    \>  Fees).
2.  Click + New.
3.  Fill out the fee overview and click
    Next.
    1.  Enter a fee name that will make sense to other people.
    2.  Select a fee vendor. If your vendor isn't listed, select one of
        the custom vendors to represent them.
    3.  Select a fee type. For more information, see
        <a href="fee-type.md" class="xref">Fee Type</a>.
    4.  Optionally enter a longer fee description.
4.  Define the fee calculation and click
    Next. For more information, see
    <a href="fee-calculations.md" class="xref">Fee Calculations</a>.
    1.  Select % (percentage) or
        CPM. If you select
        CPM, select a currency.
        **Note**: Line item currency is inherited from the advertiser.
        If a fee is created in a currency other than the line item
        currency, then we will automatically convert the fee to the line
        item currency at the time of transaction.
    2.  Select a calculation method.
5.  Make the fee eligible for advertisers.
    1.  Select the advertisers for which the fee should be eligible.
    2.  Determine whether the fee should be required for all line items.
    3.  Determine the supply type(s) to which the fee applies (Open
        Exchange Buys, Managed Buys, or Deals).



<b>Important:</b> If a fee is required for all
line items, it will be required for all newly created line items and any
line items that are opened and edited. Users will not be able to remove
the fee from the line item. If you decide you do not want the fee to
apply to a line item after all, you must first change the partner fee to
be optional, and then remove the fee from the line item.
