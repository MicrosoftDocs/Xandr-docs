# Guaranteed Outcomes Limitations



Buying and selling guaranteed outcomes has the following limitations:

- Guaranteed Outcomes is only available using the Augmented Line Item
  (ALI)
- Guaranteed Outcomes is only available when buying Open Exchange and
  Deal inventory.
- Outcome-based bids are not accepted when clearing directly with a
  third-party seller, or when buying managed inventory.

You can, however, guarantee ad delivery for managed inventory using
managed vCPM. For more information, see "Set Revenue Type" in the
