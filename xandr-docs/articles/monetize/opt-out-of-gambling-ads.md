# Opt Out of Gambling Ads



Xandr allows gambling ads in certain countries
where such advertising is not prohibited. If you don't want to permit
gambling ads to serve on your or your publishers' inventory, this page
describes how to ban gambling ads from serving on such inventory.

Option 1. Exclude gambling ads from several publishers at once

Complete the attached <a
href="../attachments/opt-out-of-gambling-ads/gambling-publisher-opt-out-worksheet.xlsx"
class="xref">Excel Worksheet</a> by entering a list of
Xandr publisher IDs or codes. These IDs and
codes represent inventory where you don't want gambling ads to run. Once
you've finished completing the worksheet, email it to
<a href="mailto:gamblingoptout@appnexus.com" class="xref"
target="_blank">gamblingoptout@appnexus.com</a>.
(You'll need to CC: your Xandr representative as
well.) We will update your Ad Quality settings to opt out of gambling
ads on those publishers.

Option 2. Exclude gambling ads from all publishers

If you don't want to permit gambling ads to serve on any of your
publishers, follow these steps:

Step 1. Navigate to the network Ad Quality Manager

Open the network Ad Quality Manager by navigating to
Network
\>  Ad Quality.

Step 2. Open the Category Eligibility Settings dialog

Locate the Categories section. Find
and click the Edit button to open the
Category Eligibility Settings
dialog.

Step 3. Ban the Gambling category

Search for the Gambling category and
click the Edit link. Then change the
status to Banned, and click
Save.

Option 3. Exclude gambling ads on a per-publisher basis

If you don't want to permit gambling ads to serve on specific
publishers' inventory, follow these steps for each publisher:

Step 1. Navigate to the publisher Ad Quality Manager

Open the publisher Ad Quality Manager by navigating to
Publishers
\> Ad Quality.

Step 2. Ban the Gambling category

The Ad Quality Manager shares the same user interface for publishers and
networks. As detailed in **Option 2** above, update Ad Quality settings
for the publisher to set the Gambling
category to Banned.
