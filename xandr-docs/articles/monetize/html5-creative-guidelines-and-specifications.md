Adhere to these guidelines and specifications when creating HTML5
creatives:

- All hosted HTML5 creatives must be uploaded in a single zip file.
- The zip file must contain an **index.html** file that resides at the
  root of the zip file and not in a subfolder.
- The **index.html** file should be a complete and valid HTML document
  that includes the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` entities.
- The `clickTag` parameter must be referenced in the URL of all HTML5
  creatives.
  

  Note: The `clickTag` parameter
  ensures that:
  - clicks are tracked properly when the creative is served.
  - the corresponding landing page can be opened when the creative is
    clicked.

  
- Creative designers can either use their own code or the helper code
  provided in the Xandr HTML5 library to
  integrate HTML5 creatives into websites efficiently. For more
