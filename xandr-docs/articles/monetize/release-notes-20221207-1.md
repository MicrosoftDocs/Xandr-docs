# Microsoft Monetize - Budget rollover for line items

**Release date**: December 7, 2022

We are releasing a new feature **Underspend Budget Rollover** for line items for all Microsoft Monetize clients. This feature enables you to:

- Extend a past flight, or
- Rollover unused budget from a past flight to a future one when it has not delivered its entire budget

You will now see line items that have **rollover** eligibility in both Buyer Monitoring Workflow (BMW) and the Analytics tabs, they will have our newest **rollover** icon next to budgets.
