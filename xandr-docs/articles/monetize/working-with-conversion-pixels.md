# Working with Conversion Pixels



A conversion pixel is used to track user actions in response to an
advertiser's creatives, such as registering at a site or making a
purchase. When a conversion pixel fires, we determine if the conversion
(the registration, the purchase, etc.) can be "attributed", or tied to
the user clicking on or viewing one of the advertiser's creatives
previously.

Here's how it works:

1.  You create and export a conversion pixel.
2.  You ask the advertiser to place the pixel on the page where the user
    action should be noted, for example, the confirmation page for a
    registration or the checkout page for a purchase.
3.  You associate the conversion pixel to the advertiser's line item(s),
    where you define the static revenue value that the advertiser will
    pay you for attributed conversions. Note that you can also configure
    to pass an
    <a href="conversion-pixels-advanced.md" class="xref">advanced
    conversion pixel</a>.
4.  When the conversion pixel fires, we determine if the user clicked on
    or viewed one of the advertiser's creatives previously. If so, the
    conversion is considered attributed, and you earn the revenue for
    the conversion defined in the line item.
