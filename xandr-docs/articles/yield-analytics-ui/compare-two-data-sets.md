# Compare Two Data Sets



You can compare information by applying different metric filters to two
data sets. For example, you might want to compare two different date
ranges or advertisers.

1.  In the Metric Filters panel, click next to the first data set tab. A
    second data set tab appears with the same Configuration panel values
    and dimension filter values as the first data set. Initially, it
    also has the same metric filter values. 
2.  (Optional) Rename the data set tabs to reflect the associated values
    by double-clicking the active tab name and typing a new name.   
    Changes to data set tabs are reflected in the chart legend and the
    grid column names. 
3.  Select a data set by clicking its tab and then change its filters as
    needed, selecting different metric filters for each of the data sets
    that you want to compare. 

In the chart view, information for the two data sets appears in
side-by-side bars. In the graph view, information for the two data sets
appears in separate adjacent columns.
