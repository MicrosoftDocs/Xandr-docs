# Managing User Logins and Permissions



The pages mentioned in this section describe how to create and manage
your users, set up their passwords and permissions.

With consolidation of Xandr to Microsoft family, we have integrated the
authentication process of the users (who are using Xandr products) to
the Microsoft Identity Platform. The profound advantage of this
integration is that users would be able use to access Xandr applications
using the same sign-on methods to access other Microsoft products.
Additionally, the integration to the Microsoft Identity Platform enables
new and more secure methods of authentication, powered by Microsoft.
