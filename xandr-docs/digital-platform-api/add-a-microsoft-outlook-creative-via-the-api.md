# Add a Microsoft Outlook creative via the API

Microsoft Outlook creatives show up in the right-hand sidebar of the free [outlook.com](https://www.microsoft.com/) webmail service after a user securely logs in. This page provides specifications for Outlook creatives and shows you how to add them to our system via the [Creative Service](./creative-service.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Outlook creatives must pass our SSL audit and the Microsoft Creative Acceptance Policy audit.

## Specifications

This section defines the fields of the [Creative Service](./creative-service.md) that are required for Outlook creatives. These fields must be passed in the JSON object on POST. See [Step 1](#step-1-create-a-json-file-with-your-creative-details) below for formatting details.

## Auditing requirements

- [SSL Audit](#ssl-audit)
- [Microsoft Creative Acceptance Policy Audit](#microsoft-creative-acceptance-policy-audit)

### SSL audit

Since [outlook.com](https://www.microsoft.com/) consists of secure inventory, Outlook creatives must pass our SSL audit in order to serve. When you add an Outlook creative to Xandr, opt into secure audit by setting `allow_ssl_audit` to `true`. For details about checking the state of the secure audit, see [Check the Audit Status of an Outlook Creative](#check-the-audit-status-of-the-outlook-creative).

### Microsoft creative acceptance policy audit

All creatives serving on [outlook.com](https://www.microsoft.com/) inventory must pass our platform audit and the Microsoft Creative Acceptance Policy audit, for which Xandr charges a standard audit fee. When you submit an Outlook creative to Xandr's secure audit, the creative is submitted to the Microsoft Creative Acceptance Policy audit by default. There's no additional option to set. For details about checking the state of the Microsoft audit, see [Check the Audit Status of an Outlook Creative](#check-the-audit-status-of-the-outlook-creative).

## Step 1. Create a JSON file with your creative details

For details about the fields to include in your JSON, see [Specifications](#specifications) above. Note that this example is for adding an Outlook creative hosted by a third-party.

```
$ cat outlook_creative
{
   "creative": {
      "name": "Outlook Creative",
      "media_url":"http://creative.com/123",
      "media_url_secure":"https://creative.com/123",
      "width": 100,
      "height": 72,
      "click_url": "https://www.testing.com",
      "file_name": "photo 1.JPG",
      "allow_ssl_audit": true,
      "template": {
         "id": 3033
      },
      "custom_macros": [
         {
            "code": "HEADLINE",
            "value": "This is the headline of the Outlook creative."
         },
         {
            "code": "DESCRIPTION",
            "value": "This is the description of the Outlook creative."
         },
         {
            "code": "FLEX_LABEL",
            "value": "This is the optional, additional description for the Outlook creative."
         },
         {
            "code": "PIXEL_URL",
            "value": "https://pixel-url.com"
         },
         {
            "code": "PIXEL_URL2",
            "value": "https://pixel-url2.com"
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

## Step 2. `POST` the JSON file to the creative service

```

## Next steps

### Check the audit status of the Outlook creative

Once you've added an Outlook creative to our system, you can check where it is in the Xandr's Secure Platform and Microsoft Acceptance Policy audits. For more details, see [Check the Audit Status of an Outlook creative](check-the-audit-status-of-an-outlook-creative-via-the-api.md).

### Create an Outlook campaign

You can use the Campaign Service and the Profile Service to set up a campaign that targets [outlook.com](https://www.microsoft.com/) inventory. For more details, see [Create an Outlook Campaign via the API](./create-an-outlook-campaign-via-the-api.md).
