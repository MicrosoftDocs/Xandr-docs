# Managing Notification Recipients



From the Network menu, you can control who
receives email notifications from Xandr for
various alerts, including creative audit, object limit, inventory
deactivation, and toolbar flag alerts using your notification settings.



Tip: If you need multiple team members
to receive notifications, you might want to create an email list that
you can manage internally and use a single address for notification
emails. For example, `notification@yourcompany.com` could include
multiple internal team members, and you could adjust notification
recipients by adding them to, or removing them from, the main
`notification@yourcompany.com` list. You wouldn't have to make any
additional changes within your notification settings.
