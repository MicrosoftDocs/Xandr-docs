# Native creative smart image adjustments - Bidder

Buyers can use Smart Image Adjustments to automatically resize their main native creative image and icon with a few clicks of the mouse so that they can quickly meet the publisher's placement criteria.

## Accessing smart image adjustments

By default, the **Allow Smart Image Adjustments** toggle is enabled for all buyers under a bidder. To keep to our recommended native best practices, see [Buying Native Inventory](../invest/buying-native-inventory.md).

If buyers would like to make adjustments to their Smart Image Adjustment settings, please file a support ticket ([help.xandr.com](https://help.xandr.com/s/login/)) or reach out to your Xandr representative.

## Smart image adjustments process

If buyers bid with a native creative image that doesn't exactly match the dimensions of a publisher's placement, Xandr will automatically resize the image by adding white bars to fill the placement when the **Allow Smart Image** **Adjustments** is enabled.

When using Smart Image Adjustments within Bidders, the main native creative image and icon can only be resized up to 200% and down to 50% of the original aspect ratio. Smart Image Adjustments can also convert native creative images vertically and horizontally. This can be done with our Creative Service API , which gives you more control over the max scale factor and aspect ratio bounds. For more information, see [Creative API Services](creative-api-services.md). The original dimensions of the native creative ultimately determine what is possible.

## Recommendations

- Smart Image Adjustments only work for the following file types:
  - .png
  - .jpg
  - .jpeg
  - .gif
- Make sure that Image URLs return valid content. Image URLs that return non-200, non-image content will not display properly.
- To ensure the best viewer experience, we recommend that you host image assets in the appropriate geographic region for your audience. Poorly distributed image assets can lead to slower image fetch times.
