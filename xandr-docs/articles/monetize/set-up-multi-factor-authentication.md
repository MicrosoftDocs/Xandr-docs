# Set Up Multi-Factor Authentication



This will guide you through the multi-factor authentication set up
process.



When signing in for the first time, you will be directed through the
process for setting up your Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) account.
You will receive a notification to **Download Auth0 Guardian for free**.
There will be two primary selections (App Store for Apple and Google
Play), and one alternative selection (Google Authenticator) available.
You can select any of them.



Note: If you have already downloaded
one of the two choices of primary selections, click **I've already
downloaded it** verbiage to alert the system.







This task explains how to set up your MFA account.





1.  Once you download any of the selections
    mentioned above, a QR code is displayed. Scan this QR code with
    Google Authenticator, or a similar app.
    

    If you have trouble scanning, there is a placeholder available to
    enter your passcode. You also have the option of using Guardian.

    
2.  A recovery code screen is displayed. In the
    event that you need to log in without your device, you will need
    this recovery code. Note this code, and keep it somewhere
    safe.
3.  Click the arrow
    \> to continue.
    

    A notification is displayed that you have successfully set up
    multi-factor authentication.

    
4.  When you log in to the application, enter your
    email address and password and click
    Next.
5.  If using Google Authenticator, open your MFA
    application to access the one-time six digit code. Enter this
    six-digit code to authenticate and log in.
    

    

    Note: You will have a limited
    amount of time to enter this code as after a certain time period it
    expires.

    

    

    Note: This is a one-time use code.
    You need to enter a new code every time when you try to
    authenticate.

    

    
6.  If using Auth0 Guardian, open your MFA
    application to access your notifications to accept the MFA
    challenge. You will not need any authentication code like Google
    Authenticator as Auth0 Guardian creates a push notification that you
    need to acknowledge to proceed.





You can use your MFA credentials to log in to your digital application
user accounts now. Post login, you can switch between your user accounts
following the steps described in
