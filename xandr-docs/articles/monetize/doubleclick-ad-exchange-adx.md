# Google Ad manager

Xandr has brandsafe creative policies, but in
order to run ads through the Google Ad Manager, you must also follow the
requirements below.

## Enabling your Xandr member seat for Google Ad Manager buying

Xandr member seats do not have access to Google
Ad Manager by default; the ability to buy Google Ad Manager inventory
requires a separate enablement process for each
Xandr member seat. There are two types of
setups:

- Standard setup: Member purchases Google Ad Manager inventory through
  the Xandr parent seat.
- Alternate setup: Member has their own seat on Google Ad Manager and it
  is linked to a Xandr member ID

The standard setup is a simple process that does not require a waiting
period. The alternate setup requires the client to work with Google Ad
Manager to obtain a seat on their exchange. Once this seat is obtained,
it needs to be linked to an Xandr member ID.
This process can take two to four weeks to complete.

> [!NOTE]
> - Mapping of Google Ad Manager seats to Xandr seats is 1:1 - you cannot link multiple Google Ad Manager seats to one Xandr seat or vice versa
> 
> - The seat in Google Ad Manager must exist as a child of the Xandr Google Ad Manager seat - you cannot link any other type of Google Ad Manager seat to an Xandr member

To begin the enablement process for your Xandr
member seat, please submit a ticket to our Business Support team via our
[Customer Support Portal](https://help.xandr.com/s/login/) and copy in your Account Manager (if applicable). If
you have already contacted Google and you do not qualify for an Google
Ad Manager seat, please reach out to your Account Manager or Business
Support to discuss alternate options for buying Google Ad Manager.

## Use of technology vendors

Ad Exchange buyers are allowed to use many technology vendors that
utilize tools such as ad servers, research technologies, and
remarketing. This is implemented by an advertiser calling another
vendor's URL in their HTML snippet. When this is done, we consider this
a "4th party" call.

Google maintains a [list of technology vendors](https://developers.google.com/third-party-ads/adx-vendors) that are
approved to run on Ad Exchange. Any vendor not on the list is prohibited
from being used in Ad Exchange.
[Check the list](https://developers.google.com/third-party-ads/adx-vendors) to determine if a technology vendor you use is approved.

## Google Ad Manager standards and policy

In order to buy Google Ad Manager inventory, creatives must also meet
Google's standards and policy requirements, and must pass a separate
audit in the Google Ad Manager system. You can find more information on
this process in [Google Ad Manager Creative Audit Process](adx-creative-audit-process.md).

## Transacting deals with Google Ad Manager
