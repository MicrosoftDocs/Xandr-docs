# TinyTag service

The TinyTag Service enables you to create TinyTag IDs as well as modify
and view them.

The IDs are associated with information about the ad space such as size,
reserve price, and what brands or creatives are allowed to run in that
space. This information is stored server side with
Xandr and is easy to modify.

TinyTag IDs can be used in TinyTags, which are placed directly on
publisher pages and take the basic form
`https://ib.``adnxs``.com/tt?id=1`. Further
information can be passed in a TinyTag using [Dynamic TinyTag Parameters.](dynamic-tinytag-parameters.md).

Note that the member associated with the TinyTag ID has rights of first
refusal on the inventory, and will receive credit (or cash) if another
member purchases it.

### Supported media types

Creatives are categorized by media type and media subtype. Media type
defines the general display style of the creative, for example,
"Banner", and media subtype defines the specific display style of
creatives, for example, "Standard Banner" or "In-Banner Video". You can
use this array to limit the media type, the general display style of
creatives, that can serve on a placement. To limit the media subtype,
the specific display style of creatives, use the
supported_media_subtypes array (see [Supported Media Subtypes](#supported-media-subtypes) below).

| Field | Type   | Description                                       |
|-------|--------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `id`    | int    | The ID of the allowed media subtype.              |
| `name`  | string | **Read-only**. The name of the allowed media subtype. |

### Supported media subtypes

Creatives are categorized by media type and media subtype. Media type
defines the general display style of the creative, for example,
"Banner", and media subtype defines the specific display style of
creatives, for example, "Standard Banner" or "In-Banner Video". You can
use this array to limit the media subtype, the specific display style of
creatives, that can serve on a placement. To limit the media type, the
general display style of creatives, use the supported_media_types array
(see [Supported Media Subtypes](#supported-media-subtypes) above).

| Field | Type   | Description                                       |
|-------|--------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `id`    | int    | The ID of the allowed media subtype.              |
| `name`  | string | Read-only. The name of the allowed media subtype. |

> [!TIP]
> **Notes on Supported Media Types and Media Subtypes**
>
> - If you do not specify either supported media types or supported media subtypes, the "Banner" media type will be allowed by default.
>
> - You can combine the "Banner" and "Text" media types, and any combination of their media subtypes, on a single placement, but you cannot combine any of the other media types and media subtypes. This limitation ensures that only appropriate creatives are served on a placement. For example, a placement that allows creatives of the media type "Video" is intended to be fed to a video player; it would not make sense to allow creatives of any other media type, such as "Interstitial", to serve on the placement. 
>
> -  You can set a placement to allow the "Expandable" media type or any of
 > its subtypes for direct inventory. If you want to support expandable creatives for placements that are available for reselling to other platform members, please provide the URL to [support](http://support.xandr.com/) for verification.

### Default Creatives

You use this array to assign default creatives to the placement. Please
note the following requirements:

- A default creative must not be expired. See the is_expired field in
  the Creative Service for more information.
- A default creative must be assigned to a creative template that
  matches the supported_media_types and supported_media_subtypes of the
  placement. For example, if the placement allows creatives of the
  "Banner" media type, you would not be able to associate default
  creatives that use a creative template for the "Interstitial" media
  type. See the template field in the [Creative Service](creative-service.md) for more information.
- If the placement is sized (the "width" and "height" fields are defined
  for the placement), this array should contain only one creative with
  the matching dimensions.

| Field  | Type   | Description                                                                         |
|--------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `height` | int    | The height of the default creative.                                                 |
| `id`     | int    | The ID of the default creative.                                                     |
| `name`   | string | **Read-only**. The name of the default creative.                                        |
| `price`  | double | The reserve price for the default creative. A winning bid must be above this price. |
| `width`  | int    | The width of the default creative.                                                  |


### Pop values

If the supported_media_type is "Pop", or the supported_media_subtypes is
"Popup" or "Popunder", these fields should be included in the
"pop_values" array. Please see below for an example.

| Field             | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                              | Default          |
|-------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| pop_freq_duration | int     | See pop_freq_times.                                                                                                                                      | No frequency cap |
| pop_freq_times    | int     | Number of times that the tag can be popped to a unique user in pop_frequency_duration seconds. Has no effect when pop_is_prepop is set to true.          | No frequency cap |
| pop_is_prepop     | boolean | If true, the tag is a prepop tag and will serve into a window that the publisher page has already popped.                                                | false            |
| pop_max_height    | int     | The max height of the creative. If pop_max_height is specified, any creative shown by the tag must have a height equal to or smaller than pop_max_height | no max height    |
| pop_max_width     | int     | If pop_max_width is specified, any creative shown by the tag must have a width equal to or smaller than pop_max_width                                    | no max width     |

### Estimated clear prices

| clear_price   | int     | The bid amount that has historically won the majority (95%) of the 3rd party auctions in which it participates for this placement. |
| height        | int     | When exporting sizeless placement tags to be served, this determines the height of the placement.                                  |
| verified      | boolean | Indicates whether the created prices are verified.                                                                                 |
