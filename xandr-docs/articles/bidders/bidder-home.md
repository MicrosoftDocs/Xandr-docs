# Bidder Home



A bidder is a decisioning brain that calculates real-time auction bids
using an algorithm and parameters such as user data, recency, location,
etc. and plugs into one or more inventory sources using real-time
bidding (RTB) APIs. Clients with existing bidders can plug in to the
Xandr real-time platform to expand their access to premium and unique
sources of supply and engage in transparent and technologically advanced
media buying.

The documentation you'll find here will help you navigate the Xandr
software in support of bidders. This includes information on using our
API services, integrating bidders, and the OpenRTB protocol. You can
browse through the help resources we've provided here to learn more.
