# Microsoft Monetize - Fee type

When creating a [partner fee](partner-fees.md), you can use fee types to categorize fees by purpose.

Supported types are:

- Ad serving
- Algorithm
- Data
- Reporting
- Service
- Technology
- Viewability
- Other

We recommend that you include additional details in the fee name or description, especially for fees of type "Other".
