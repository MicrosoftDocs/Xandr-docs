# Microsoft Curate - Political advertising

Microsoft Curate no longer permits political advertising on its platform.  This includes election-related content, fundraising for political candidates, hot button political issue ads, and advertising that exploits a political agenda or sensitive political issues.

<!--Xandr permits political advertising (advertising relating to elections, ballot initiatives, or political candidates) in the United States, but requires that such advertising comply with applicable law. As required by law, you must certify certain information about the ads and the political organization that purchased them for all political advertising on the state or local level, and for political advertising on the federal level in Washington State.

You are not required to certify political advertising serving outside the United States, but you must still adhere to our [Policies for Curating](../policies-regulations/index.yml) and comply with all applicable legal and/or regulatory requirements in the jurisdiction where you are advertising.

Unless specifically authorized by Xandr, curators are prohibited from serving ads related to any federal elections in Canada.

For more details on our policies on political advertising, see our [Political Advertising Policy](../policies-regulations/index.yml). For more information about our transparency reporting, see [Political Advertising Transparency Reporting](../policies-regulations/index.yml).

## Enable political advertising

For the most part, political advertisements are set up in the same way as other advertisements, using the same basic curated
deal setup procedures. For more information, see [Create a Curated Deal Line Item](create-a-curated-deal-line-item.md).
However, you must take a few additional steps:

1. Declare that the advertiser is going to run political advertising. For more details, see [Create an Advertiser](create-an-advertiser.md).
2. If your local or state political ads could or will serve in California, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Virginia, or Washington, or your federal political ads could or will serve in Washington State, fill out the **Political Advertising** section on the relevant insertion orders. If your political ad will not be served in any of those states, you may enter "N/A”.

    1. Add the contact information for the person or team in your own organization who can best answer any questions about political advertising on this insertion order.
    2. Add details about the political organization that is advertising on a state or local level, or on a federal level in Washington State. The details include contact information, payment method, and the name of the candidate or ballot initiative being supported or opposed.
    3. If the political organization purchasing the ads is an independent expenditure committee advertising in New York or New Jersey, upload the appropriate state registration form.
    4. Certify that all information provided is accurate and up to date, and acknowledge that Xandr is relying on the accuracy of the information you provide. 
    For more details, see [Political Advertising](create-an-insertion-order.md#political-advertising) in [Create an Insertion Order](create-an-insertion-order.md).

3. Ensure that political creatives include a disclaimer stating who paid for the advertisement and whether it was authorized by the
    relevant candidate or paid for by an independent expenditure committee.

## When a political creative is not allowed to serve

The creative will not be allowed to serve if:

- You have declared that an insertion order contains political advertising that could or will serve in a state with public reporting
  requirements, but you have not disclosed the required political information on the insertion order, certified that the information you
  provided on the advertiser or the insertion is true, or uploaded a registration form for the states that require it.
- An audit detects that a creative is political, but the required political information has not been disclosed to Xandr.

If the buyer's creative is blocked from serving by a creative audit, the buyer will be emailed a notification that the creative does not comply with Xandr's policies and has been blocked until all issues are resolved. Generally, all this requires is that the buyer include the proper disclosures and information at the Advertiser and Insertion Order level.

## Political reporting transparency requirements

To comply with the public reporting required by law in certain states, Xandr retains certain data about the U.S. political advertisements that are served using our technology. This reporting is updated daily, and is stored for four years.

Currently, the states with public reporting requirements for state or local political advertising are California, Illinois,
Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Virginia, and Washington.

Washington State also has a public reporting requirement for political advertising for federal elections or candidates.

For more information, see [Political Advertising Transparency Reporting](../policies-regulations/index.yml).
