# Import users

If you have administrative permissions, you can quickly add multiple users to Yield Analytics by importing a CSV (comma-separated values) file that contains a set of usernames and passwords.

1. On the **Admin Tools** menu, click **Users**. The **Users** page appears, displaying a list of all user accounts.
1. At the bottom of the list, in the **CSV File** field, click **Choose File**.
1. In the dialog that appears, select the CSV file you want to import.
1. Click **Import Users**. The new accounts are added to the list, and the system displays a count of the users that were successfully created.
