# Microsoft Invest - February 17, 2022: Enhancements to the ALI setup experience

As part of Xandr's ongoing effort to make augmented line item setup quicker and more intuitive, we've made several updates to the line item page. These include a more intuitive budgeting workflow, additional IO-level budget allocation details for easy reference, an updated segment targeting component and usability enhancements for the creatives section. For more detailed information, edit or create an augmented line item and follow the prompts to check out the updates.
