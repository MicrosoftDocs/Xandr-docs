# RTSS use cases

- **Publishers** – For publishers and their DMPs, RTSS provides a viable alternative to onboard and monetize their **first-party (1P) audience** based on contextual signals in a secure, privacy-compliant way.  
- **Curators** – RTSS enables curators to create **context-based audiences** using alternative signals. They can then pair these unique audience data with supply from the **Xandr exchange** to create media products and sell them through deals to any DSP.  
- **Buyers** – RTSS allows buyers to create their own audiences or access **premium publishers' audiences**, enabling targeting in a **cookieless environment**, such as CTV.
