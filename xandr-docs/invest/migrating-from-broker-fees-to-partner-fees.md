# Microsoft Invest - Migrating from broker fees to partner fees

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Partner Fees are an enhancement and replacement for [Broker Fees](broker-fees.md) for augmented line items (ALIs) and programmatic guaranteed line items (PGLIs).

If you're migrating from [Broker Fees](broker-fees.md), you'll find partner fees work differently in a few ways:

- Partner fees can be eligible for multiple advertisers and can be applied to multiple line items.
- A particular partner fee can be made required or optional for all an advertiser's augmented line items.
- Partner fees cannot be applied to insertion orders.

All serving fees on existing augmented line items have already been converted to partner fees. You can view them in the
**Fees** section of the line item. If you have Member-level access, hover over your member name in the upper-right corner of the menu bar and click **Fees** to access the **Fees** screen.

## Reporting changes

With partner fees, several new metrics have been added to reports and there has been a standardization of how metrics are named and calculated across different reports. This resulted in the deprecation of some metrics and changes in the definitions of others.

Fields are now defined as follows for every report in which they appear:

- **Partner fees**: The total amount of third party costs, budgeted using Partner Fees, that have accrued on an augmented line item over the reported period of time.

- **Total cost**: All costs that are paid out to third parties. For buyers, total cost is all costs included in the budget, including media cost, data cost, partner fees, serving fees, and commissions. Total costs are calculated as follows:
  - **Total cost**: media costs + data cost + partner fees + commissions + serving fees OR publisher revenue
  - **Total cost eCPM**: (total cost/imps) * 1,000
  - **Total cost eCPC**: total cost/clicks
  - **Total cost eCPA**: total cost/conversions

- **Profit**: In the past, we have sometimes used "profit" to represent buyer profit and sometimes used it to represent Member profit. Going forward, it will always indicate buyer profit (booked revenue - total cost).

- **Member profit**: The sum of booked revenue and reseller revenue, minus total cost.

    Profit metrics based on including broker fees or data cost, but not including media cost, will be retired, in favor of the new definition of profit based on total cost. You will still be able to determine separate media and data costs.

## Transition period

The transition to partner fees was completed **November 12, 2019**. For reports and metrics related to ALIs prior to that date, some things to keep in mind:

- Reports which already had profit fields will continue to use the definitions they had used in the past.
- Logic was added to prevent double-counting third party costs (partner fees vs commissions & serving fees) in total cost metrics for ALIs.
- Commissions are no longer populated for augmented line items. These fees appear in the **partner fees** field.

## Affected reports

The changes for each report are summarized in the tables below.
