# Data Sharing

<div class="body">

Data providers can expose their segments to data buyers by participating
in the <span class="ph">Xandr</span> Data Provider program  (contact
your <span class="ph">Xandr</span> representative for more
information) or using the Member Data Sharing Service for real-time data
providers (if you have a bidder) or the Member Data Sharing Service for
audience data providers (if you do not have a bidder or real-time
integration).

<div class="note">

<span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <span class="ph">Xandr</span> does
not permit clients to share segments with third parties until the data
provider has signed our data access agreement. Clients may share
first-party data if they have multiple member IDs under the same company
on our platform. Please contact your <span class="ph">Xandr</span>
representative if interested in signing the data access agreement.
