# Microsoft Invest - Creative FAQ

Here are some answers to common questions on creatives.

## Why is my creative skewed/truncated?

Most likely the the wrong tag size was selected.

## My creative isn't showing up. What's wrong?

A quick note: most creative issues can be mitigated by uploading content
directly onto our server and then inputting click/tracking URLs in the
designated field. Our server is approved across all supply partners, so
if your creative passes our auditing, it may be more likely to be
permitted on restrictive supply sources like Google Ad Manager than if
it is hosted by a third-party ad server.

There are a few things you can look for before sending a ticket into
Xandr Support. First, does the trafficking code
(html, javascript, etc.) match the creative? A javascript tag that is
interpreted as pure html (e.g. `<script></script>`) should be trafficked
as html. Raw javascript (e.g. `var x = "my tag"`) should be trafficked
as such. The tag code determines how that impression bus will deliver
the ad (i.e. if it will be wrapped within a doc.write or not), so it is
often the problem behind blank creatives.

If your tag code is correct, load a creative preview using our server
URL:

[https://creative-preview-an.com/cached/creative/insert creative id here](https://creative-preview-an.com/cached/creative/insert%20creative%20id%20here)

After refreshing a few times, if the page is blank, you should inspect
the creative's tag content. Check to see if there are any glaring format
errors such as spacing, etc. Please note that we do not support
javascript comments at this time. If the tag has comments, remove the
comment wrappers:

`<!//----\ ----//>`

When you edit and save the creative, wait 10-15 seconds before
refreshing several times to check if the changes worked.

If none of the above steps work, you can test to see if the problem is
on our end: copy your tag into a text file, save it as an html, and open
the html file with your browser. If it doesn't load, then the issue lies
with the tag or 3rd party content. If the creative loads, the issue is
specific to Microsoft Monetize. If removing comment wrappers or altering
incorrect formatting doesn't remedy the problem and the creative is
loading in your browser, feel free to submit a support ticket.

## I'm not seeing any clicks, so why does my creative appear to be serving?

We now have a built-in click-tracking test in the creative Full Edit
pane.

**Flash creatives**: Make sure that the **clickTAG** macro is
capitalized correctly as it is case sensitive. However, note that some
flash creatives use other capitalization variations (e.g. clickTag). You
can decompile the flash file using a free software utility (e.g. Flare)
to check.

Please see [Click Tracking](click-tracking.md) for further details on click tracking. If you are still
having problems, please contact Xandr Support.

## Can I run creatives in different languages?

Please see [International Creatives](../bidders/international-creatives.md).

## What happens if multiple creatives are attached to the same line item?

If the creatives are different sizes, then the appropriate size will be
chosen for the publisher's tag. If there are several creatives of the
same size, one creative will be chosen at random for each impression,
assuming they are all eligible based on frequency and recency
parameters.

## Why won't my creative click through properly in Full Edit mode?

Currently, the creative preview in Full Edit is not intended to be fully
functional. You can click through outside of Full Edit mode, or use the
following URL to serve your creative:

` [https://creative-preview-an.com/cached/creative/insert creative id here](https://creative-preview-an.com/cached/creative/insert%20creative%20id%20here) `

## Gambling creatives

under what conditions.
