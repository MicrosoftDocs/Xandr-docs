# Reports as pivot table

If you are familiar with using pivot tables, you'll find Yield Analytics Reporting easy to use. Both systems essentially work the same.

Below is a visual that describes how yield analytics builds out reports:

## Report filter

Metric Filters define what data is important within that underlying dataset. This is equivalent to Report Filter.

## Row labels

Dimensions define how you divide your data. This is equivalent to Row Labels.

Additional Dimensions divides the data in a more granular way than Dimensions does. This is equivalent of adding multiple Row Labels.

## Column labels

Using the Group By feature in Yield Analytics Reports (Configuration Section) is the equivalent of moving a dimension to the Column Label section in a pivot table. This produces the same data as before, but organized into columns instead of rows.

## Values

Metrics define what data is aggregated by your dimensions. This is equivalent to Values.

Additional Metrics add additional data fields. This is equivalent of adding multiple Values.
