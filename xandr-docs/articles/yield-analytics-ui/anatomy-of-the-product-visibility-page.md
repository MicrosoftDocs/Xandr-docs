## About the Product Visibility Interface

The Product Visibility page is comprised of the following five panels:

- Filters – This panel, which appears at the top of the page, is where
  you can refine the criteria for the analyses in the Allocated
  Inventory and Allocated Order Line panels. For example, you can change
  the default time period to look back 30 days instead of ahead 30 days,
  change the daily breakout to be week, month, quarter, or year, change
  the start and end dates, etc.. As you make changes, you must
  click Update for them to be
  accepted. Download metrics for the product to an Excel worksheet by
  clicking Export in this panel.  
    
- Product Details – This panel, which appears beneath the Filters panel,
  shows the general details and attributes defined for the product. This
  includes the product name, product type, rate card, floor CPM, and
  targeting.  
    
- Allocated Inventory – This panel, which appears beneath the Product
  Details panel, shows a graphical analysis of the inventory allocated
  to the product. This is based on the criteria you defined in
  the Filters panel.   
    
- Allocated Order Lines – This panel, which appears beneath
  the Allocated Inventory panel, shows a pie chart representing the
  order lines allocated to the product for the time period you defined
  in the Filters panel.  
    
- Allocating Order Lines – This panel, which appears beneath
  the Allocated Inventory panel, shows a comprehensive list of order
  lines allocated to the product with detailed metrics for each order
  line. This includes allocated impressions and revenue across the order
  line, as well as allocated impressions and revenue for the time period
  you defined in the Filters panel highlighted. This panel contains
  three tabs: 
  - Allocating Order Lines - This is the main tab and is selected by
    default.
  - Starving Order Lines - This is to see order lines that are
    under-delivering for the product.
  - Potential Competition - This is to see order lines potentially
    competing for the product's impressions.

Download order line data to an Excel worksheet by
clicking Export on the from
the Allocating Order Lines tab.
