# Enhancements in profile and creative services 

## Enhancements in profile service

You can define targets at the Smart line item level using the [Profile Service](profile-service.md), where a profile is a set of targeting parameters, such as gender, age, geography, and frequency. In order to the Smart line item (and Smart insertion order) capabilities to function, specific parameter-based profiles are appended to the line items generated by [Smart Line Item Service](smart-line-item-service.md). Only `enhanced_performance` line items should utilize profiles intended for Smart line items, which include the Profile ID, at the line-item level.

> [!NOTE]
> - The profile for Smart line item(s) can accommodates a subset of targeting parameters, which are listed in the [JSON fields](#profile-service-json) below. An error will occur if any targeting parameters not included in the JSON field are referenced.

The current [Profile Service](profile-service.md) is unchanged in terms of endpoint and methods. The same can be used to view, edit, and create profiles.

## Profile service JSON

| Field | Type (Length) | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
|`age_targets` |array of strings | The list of age ranges to target for this profile. The `allow_unknown` field is available as a Boolean in order to account for ad calls where the age of the user is not available. For more details and examples, see [age targets](profile-service.md#age-targets) section. Only the following ranges are allowed: <br>- `['low' => 18, 'high' => 24]`,<br> -`['low' => 25, 'high' => 34]`,<br> -`['low' => 35, 'high' => 49]`,<br> -`['low' => 50, 'high' => 64]`,<br> -`['low' => 65, 'high' => 100]`|
|`city_action` | enum | Action to be taken on the `city_targets` list. **Possible values**:<br> - `include` <br> - `exclude`<br> **Default:** `exclude` |
|`city_target`| array of objects | The IDs of cities to be either included or excluded in a profile, as defined by the `city_action` field. You can use the [City Service](city-service.md) to retrieve a list of city IDs. For more details and format, see [City Targets](profile-service.md#city-targets) below.<br> **Required On:** POST/PUT, when `city_action` is include. |
|`country_action`| enum | Action to be taken on the `country_targets` list. **Possible values**:<br> - `include` <br> - `exclude`<br> **Default:** `exclude` |
| `country_targets` | array of objects | The country IDs to be either excluded or included in a profile, as defined by the `country_action` field. You can use the [Country Service](country-service.md) to retrieve a list of country IDs. For more details and format, see [Country Targets](profile-service.md#country-targets).<br> **Required On:** POST/PUT, when `country_action` is include. |
|`daypart_targets`| array of objects | The day parts during which to serve the campaign. For more details, see [Daypart Targets](profile-service.md#daypart-targets).<br> **Note:** If you do not set any daypart targets, the campaign will serve on all days of the week at all times. |
| `device_type_targets` | array of strings | The types of devices to either include in or exclude from your targeting, as defined by the `device_type_action` field.<br> **Possible values**: <br> - `phone` <br> - `tablet` <br> - `pc` <br> <br> For more details and format, see [Device Type Targets](profile-service.md#device-type-targets) |
|`device_type_action` | enum | Action to be taken on `device_type_targets`. `device_type` can only be defined using `device_type_action = include`, and can only target the device types mentioned above: <br> **Possible values:** `include` or `exclude` <br> **Default:** `exclude` |
|`gender_targets`| object | The gender targeting used for the profile. **Possible values** for gender are: <br> - `m(male)` <br> - `f(female)`.<br> The `allow_unknown` field is available as a Boolean in order to account for ad calls where the gender of the user is not available. For more details, see [Gender Targets](profile-service.md#device-type-targets). |
| `postal_code_targets` | object | The postal code IDs to target. IDs can be fetched using the [Postal Code Service](postal-code-service.md). |
| `postal_code_action_include` | array of objects | The Postal code list API will allow buyers to create a list of postal codes and reuse it across different objects for targeting. For more details, see [Postal Code List Service](postal-code-list-service.md) |
|`region_action` | enum | Action to be taken on the `region_targets` list.<br> **Possible values**: <br> - `include` <br> - `exclude` <br> **Default:** `exclude` |

| `segment_group_target` | array of objects | The segment groups to target. Whereas the `segment_targets` array allows you to define Boolean logic between individual segments, this array allows you to establish groups of segments, defining Boolean logic between the groups as well as between the segments within each group. You define the Boolean logic between groups with the `segment_boolean_operator` field outside of the array; you define the Boolean logic between segments in a group with the `boolean_operator` field within the group object. For more details, see [Segment Group Targets](profile-service.md#segment-group-targets). Segment group targets can only define 1 exclude group and 1 include group, and these two can only be OR’ed. Only 'In-Market' segments are allowed to be targeted. <br> **Note:** Null segments cannot be added. You may not add null segments to this array using `POST` or `PUT`. |

## Enhancements in creative service
The [Creative Service](creative-service.md) can be used to add creatives to our system. Only native ad types can be uploaded when associating a creative with a Smart line item. 
As with the profile service mentioned above, you must use the following parameters in [JSON fields](#json-fields-for-creative-service) within the creative service when adding creatives.
