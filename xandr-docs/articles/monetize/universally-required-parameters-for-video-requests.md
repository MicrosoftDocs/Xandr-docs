# Universally required information for video requests

All video requests must include, at minimum, an IP address, a Domain/App ID, and a user ID or device ID.

This information is the minimum required for selling video inventory. However, more information is typically required to actually monetize your inventory. For more information, see [Create and Customize a Video Placement Tag](create-and-customize-a-video-placement-tag.md).
