# Bidder API services

The parameters related to the bidder are separated into three distinct categories - the bidder itself, the bidder profile, and the bidder instances. The [Bidder Service](bidder-api-services.md) is used to modify global bidder attributes, such as the handlers for the different requests sent by the impression bus. The [Legacy Bidder Profile Service](legacy-bidder-profile-service.md) is used to create and manage filtering criteria for the real-time auctions that are sent to the bidder. The [Bidder Instance Service](bidder-instance-service.md) can be used to control and view the bidder instances associated with a particular bidder.
