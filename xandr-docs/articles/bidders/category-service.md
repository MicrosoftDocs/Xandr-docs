# Bidders - Category service

The read-only Category Service allows you to view all categories that are registered in the Xandr system. Categories are assigned to both brands and creatives - you can see what categories are assigned using the [Brand Service](brand-service.md) or the [Creative Service](creative-service.md). You can then allow or disallow these categories of brands and creatives using the [Ad Profile Service](ad-profile-service.md).

> [!NOTE]
> For site and placement categories, use the [Content Category Service](content-category-service.md).

## REST API

## JSON fields
