# Anatomy of the Availability Lookup Page



On the Availability Lookup page on
the Availability tab, you can search
for available inventory using a variety of criteria, including
attributes from existing products, attributes from a product group, and
custom defined attributes. You can also open saved lookups, save new
lookups, and create batches to search for inventory across products and
run the lookup in the background.


## About the Availability Lookup Interface

The Availability Lookup page is comprised of the following four panels:

- Configuration – This panel, on the top left side of the page, is where
  you select the high-level settings for your lookup. This includes the
  time period and how you want results grouped. 
- Lookup Criteria – This panel, on the bottom left side of the page, is
  where you select the products, product groups, and/or attributes for
  your lookup.
- Lookup Request – This panel is populated with the product(s) and
  attribute(s) you select in the Lookup Criteria panel. You can look up
  available inventory using a search for products that match all of a
  set of specified attributes and/or any of a set of specified
  attributes.
- Availability Report – This panel shows a list of the available
  inventory that meets your lookup criteria. For each product with
  available impressions, the list provides the product name, product ID,
  rate card CPM, ad targeting, total impressions, and total capacity.
  From this panel, you can access full product details for existing
  inventory. For available impressions that match your lookup but for
  which a product doesn't yet exist, you can create a new product. You
  can also export your lookup into an Excel spreadsheet (XLS) or
  comma-separated values (CSV) file.
