  the rule.

  are checked against every impression in priority order.

- Description Text description of the
  rule (optional).

- Hard floor The hard floor set within
  the rule. This is the lowest price you will accept for this inventory.

  the rule. This is the lowest price to which the winning bid will be
  reduced. (Not applicable if Floor Optimization is turned on.)

- Floor Optimization Whether Floor
  Optimization is turned on or off. Floor Optimization programmatically
  sets a new floor for each impression. See
