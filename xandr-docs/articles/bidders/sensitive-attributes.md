# Sensitive Attributes



Clicking the Sensitive
Attributes tab accesses a screen where you can select which
sensitive attributes you want to exclude.

By default, all traffic is allowed. You get traffic that has been
flagged for no sensitive attributes, and any traffic that has been
flagged for any sensitive attributes. This screen allows you to
narrow-down that targeting. Unflagged traffic is always received.



<b>Note:</b> By default, inventory with any
flagged sensitive attributes is allowed. The options described below are
to allow only specific sensitive attributes. Inventory with no flagged
sensitive attributes is always allowed.



You can select the desired sensitive attributes by clicking the green
checkmark icon.

*Example:* The bidder selects **Political** and **Social Media** from
this list. The affect of selecting these two options is that you will
receive political and social media traffic, plus <u>all unflagged
traffic</u>. You would not receive anything flagged with any of the
other attributes. 

The **magnifying glass/search icon** can be used to search for the
desired sensitive attribute to select. Begin typing the name of the
sensitive attribute you want, and this list will narrow down to your
specific choice.

When you close the Sensitive
Attributes tab, a summary is shown in the upper right-hand corner
of the Sensitive Attributes
display bar that shows that you've applied some sort of targeting.
