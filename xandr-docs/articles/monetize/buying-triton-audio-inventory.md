# Microsoft Monetize - Buying Triton audio inventory

This page provides specific information for the **Triton Audio Ad Exchange**, which includes testing your ads and setting up a line item or campaign to target **Triton** audio inventory.

## Test your ads

After designing your audio creative and adding your creative to Xandr, you can test it. (See [Buying Audio Inventory](buying-audio-inventory.md)).

Triton Digital has created a test station where you can test your a2x/Xandr ads in a replica of a live environment. The test station runs a sequence of one song followed by
one or more ads. You can test only one ad at a time.

> [!NOTE]
> To access the test station, a **custom placement ID** and a **player site ID** from Triton Digital is required. To obtain these IDs, contact Triton Digital customer support.

To set up and listen to a test ad:

1. Upload your ad using the **Creative Manager** and assign it to the **Alpha Test** brand in the **Creative Attributes** section, using the **Self-classify** audit option.
1. Create a new line item or campaign. In the **Buying Strategies** area of the **Basic Setup** section, set the **Bid a base CPM** to $1.00 CPM.

   > [!NOTE]

### Cookie categories

You can also narrow the inventory by specifying if the inventory should target players that use cookies, or those that do not. The available cookie categories are listed below.

| Category | Description |

| Cookie: Matched (924163) | Inventory that is assigned to traffic from users who are matched to an ID from Xandr using the Xandr cookie. |
| Cookie: Not Synced (24164) | Inventory that is assigned to traffic from users who are not synced with an ID from Xandr, either because the player does not support cookies or because the player does not have the cookie sync code. |

> [!NOTE]
> There are no controls to keep you from narrowing your scope to a point of excluding all inventory. For example, you can choose to exclude **Category: Mobile Browser** in a
> line item or campaign with a scope of "Mobile:Device-Optimized websites". This will leave you with no available inventory. Make sure to use prudence when targeting categories.
