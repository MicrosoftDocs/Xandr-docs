# August 26, 2021: Cross Device for Europe - Invest Changes



On August 30, 2021, Tapad cross-device targeting for Europe will
officially end in Xandr's
Invest DSP. To continue utilizing cross-device
targeting for Europe on our Invest DSP platform:
switch to the Xandr (US + EU) graph. These new
options will be available on August 26, 2021. On August 30, 2021 Tapad
cross-device targeting will be removed from line items in the EU. The
line items will continue to run, but will no longer conduct cross-device
targeting.
