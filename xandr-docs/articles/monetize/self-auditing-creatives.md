# Self-Auditing Creatives



When adding creatives to Xandr, it's to your
advantage to submit each creative to Xandr for
human auditing. The manual audit process includes checking technical
attributes, sensitive categories, offer category, brand, and language to
enable seller protection features on the platform.

If you are not able to submit creatives to Xandr
for audit, either because they do not meet our creative standards or
because Xandr does not audit your particular
creative type (interstitial or pop), we strongly encourage self-auditing
in those cases. Be sure to self-audit the technical attributes,
sensitive categories, offer category, brand, and language that have been
associated with the creative. Whereas very few sellers allow unaudited
creatives to run on their publishers' inventory, sellers often do allow
self-audited creatives, so self-auditing enables much greater access to
supply than unaudited creatives.

## Benefits of Standardization

Self-audited creatives are only eligible to run on sellers' inventory
that have set your trust level to
Medium or
Maximum in their Demand Partners
settings. As an advertiser, it is critical that you don't betray the
seller's trust and ensure that the seller can rely on your self-audit.

An ecosystem of standardized audit practices and open trust settings
will greatly increase liquidity for every member on the
Xandr platform. If a seller feels like they can
no longer control the types of creatives that serve on their inventory,
their first action will be to reduce the trust level of the buying
member and effectively limit access to their supply. Standardization
will ultimately benefit everyone by leading to more liquidity.

## Applying Sensitive Categories to Generic Creatives

One of the hardest parts of self-auditing creatives is identifying the
correct sensitive categories, especially for generic creatives.



<b>Note:</b> If you ever have questions about
how creatives should be categorized, feel free to reach out to
selfaudit@appnexus.com.

## Correctly Categorizing Download Offers

It is important to recognize the difference between the
**Download/Watch/Play Button** sensitive category and the **Software and
Web Apps** offer category. Apply the
Download/Watch/Play Button sensitive
category when the creative features a download or watch or play button.
Apply the Software and Web Apps offer
category when the landing page of the creative represents any type of
download offer except a toolbar download.

For generic creatives, whenever possible, choose additional categories
that describe the landing page. Examples of popular categories include:
dating, free giveaways, ringtones/mobile downloads, online games,
pharmaceuticals, and supplements.

## Selecting Brand and Offer Categories


In addition to applying sensitive categories to your self-audited
creatives, the correct brand and corresponding offer category should
also be selected. Many sellers ban creatives with an "unknown" brand as
they assume it means the creatives have not been audited correctly.


<b>Note:</b> Brand search is case sensitive.
It is advised to start the search with a Capital letter.





When selecting a brand, be sure to select the brand associated with the
landing page. If a brand is currently not in our system, you can submit
a request to have it added at
<a href="https://help.xandr.com" class="xref" target="_blank"><span
class="ph">https://help.xandr.com</a>. Be sure to set the
Request Type to
Creative Auditing, the
Creative Request to
Brand Addition, and provide the brand
name (typically the name of the parent company), brand URL (the main
landing page), and brand category in the
Request Description field.

If you have multiple brands to add, you can submit an Excel spreadsheet
that includes the information above for each brand.
