# Digital Platform API - API semantics

This page explains the semantics of our REST API. It includes information on:

- How to ask a service about itself: what fields it supports, which fields are filterable.
- How to get only the information you want by filtering and sorting.
- The "shape" of our [JSON](http://json.org/) responses in different scenarios.

This document assumes you have completed the [API Onboarding Process](./api-onboarding-process.md).

## HTTP protocol

The Digital Platform API supports HTTP Protocol version 1.1 or later. While some calls may work with the deprecated 1.0 version, this is not guaranteed. Please ensure that your client communicates using at least version 1.1.

## API endpoints

The URL for the production API endpoint is: [https://api.appnexus.com](https://api.appnexus.com/). Please note that non-secure access to the product API (HTTP) is not available.

Changes made with this API affect the production environment. Only authorized users should alter information or settings in this environment.

## REST semantics

Our API services are RESTful. REST (Representational State Transfer) is a type of software architecture in which requests model the communication from a web browser to a web server. Below are the central REST methods used in our API services, and their uses:

| POST | Create |
|:---|:---|
| `GET` | Read |
| `PUT` | Update |
| `DELETE` | Delete |

When making a `POST` or `PUT` request, you must include a [JSON](http://json.org/) file with the data to create or update.

> [!WARNING]
> `PUT` overwrites arrays unless `'append=true'` is added to query string.
>
> For `PUT` requests, only the fields included in the [JSON](http://json.org/) file will be updated, **except in the case of arrays**. When updating an array using `PUT`, all fields in the array are **overwritten with the contents of the new array** you upload, unless you append the following to your request query string: `"append=true"`.
>
> **Example "legacy" `PUT` request for updating an array**
>
> This example walks you through the process of properly updating the `pixels` array of creative ID 503577 using the "legacy" method; in other words, with the "overwrite arrays on `PUT`" behavior that occurs unless you append the string `"append=true"` to the query string of your request.
>
> First, let's look at the creative. Note that the `pixels` array already includes one pixel.
>
> ```
> $ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/creative?id=503577'
> {
>     "response": {
>         "status": "OK",

>             ...
>         }
>     }
> }
> ```
>
> Next, we create the [JSON](http://json.org/) file for adding a new pixel to the creative. In the file, we include both the new pixel that we want to **add** and the pixel that was already attached to the creative.
>
> If we don't include the existing pixel in the [JSON](http://json.org/) file, our update will delete that pixel from the creative.
>
> ```
> $ cat creative_update
> {
>     "creative": {
>         "pixels": [
>             {
>                 "format": "url-js",

## Using cURL

In our documentation we use [curl](http://us2.php.net/curl) to make HTTP requests. Curl is a command-line tool for transferring files with URL syntax, supporting FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, TELNET, DICT, LDAP, LDAPS, and more. Example scripts have been provided on each API wiki page to illustrate the structure of the `curl`
commands you will need to run Xandr API services. In addition, an example of how to a make a generic `POST` request is shown below. This example uses the [Authentication Service](./authentication-service.md):

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @auth.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/auth'
```

| Chunk of Request | What it Means |
|:---|:---|
| `-c cookies` | Creates a text file called `"cookies"` and stores your session token (assigned by the [Authentication Service](./authentication-service.md)). This is not a required argument to `curl` after the initial authentication, but it doesn't affect subsequent calls if it is included. |
| `-b cookies` | Retrieves the authentication token that you previously stored in the `"cookies"` text file. |
| `-X` | Indicates that you are going to make a certain type of request, in this case `"POST"`. |
| `-d` | Indicates that you are going to upload a file, in this case `"auth.json"`. |
| `'https://api.appnexus.com/auth'` | The URL of the service you are making the request to. Use quotes in case you have any special characters in your URL. |

> [!TIP]
> **Use Single Quotes Around Your Request URL**
>
> Some requests require single quotes around your request URL, as in the above `curl` request. If you get an error message from your UNIX shell, make sure your request URL has single quotes before troubleshooting further. For more information on how UNIX shell quotes and escaping work, see [this documentation on quotes and escaping in shells](http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/quoting).

## Filtering and sorting

Most API Services support filtering and sorting. Filtering allows you to specify a subset of objects to be returned. Sorting allows you to control the order of the objects returned.

> [!TIP]
> Please also see the [Search Service](search-service.md) and [Lookup Service](lookup-service.md) for ways of looking up objects across your member.

> [!NOTE]
> When filtering by fields, the filter "may" only be respected if the fields used for filtering are passed in the fields query string parameter.

## Get multiple objects by ID

You can get multiple specific objects by ID by passing a comma-separated list of IDs. The result object will contain an array holding just those specific objects. In the example below, we ask the [Campaign Service](./campaign-service.md) for just the campaigns with IDs 1, 2, and 3.

```
$ curl -bc -cc 'https://api.appnexus.com/campaign?id=1,2,3
{ 
  "response" : {
     "count" : 3,
     "status" : "OK",
     "campaigns" : [ ... ]
  }
}
      
```

## Filter by IDs

Pass a query string parameter for the field with a comma-separated list of IDs.

### Example: Request all campaigns for certain line items

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/campaign?advertiser_id=40&line_item_id=1,2,3' 
```

### Example: Request certain advertisers

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/advertiser?id=3'
```

> [!TIP]
> Only 100 objects will be returned per request
>
> The maximum number of objects that can be returned, regardless of pagination, is 100. If you request over 100 objects, we will only return the first 100 and will not provide an error message. For more information on how to paginate API results, see [Paging](#paging).

## Filter by min and max values

Fields that are of the type `int`, `double`, `date`, or `money` can be filtered by `min` and `max`. For example:

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/campaign?min_id=47'
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/campaign?min_advertiser_id=20'
```

Fields of the type `date` can be filtered by `nmin` and `nmax` as well. The `nmin` filter lets you find dates that are either `null` or after the specified date, and the `nmax` filter lets you find dates that are either `null` or before the specified date. For example:

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/campaign?nmax_start_date=2012-12-20+00:00:00'
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/campaign?nmin_end_date=2013-01-01+00:00:00'
```

Note the required date/time syntax in the preceding example: YYYY-MM-DD+HH:MM:SS

Another option for filtering by date is to use the `min_last_modified` filter:

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/campaign?min_last_modified=2017-10-27+21:00:00'
```

## Filter by field names

To limit the response to specific fields of an object, pass the `fields` query string parameter with a comma-separated list of field names. For example:

```
$ curl -b cookies "https://api.appnexus.com/user?current&fields=username,user_type,id"
{
    "response":{
        "status":"OK",
        "count":1,
        "start_element":0,
        "num_elements":100,
        "user":{
            "id":14311,
             "username":"rloveland",
             "user_type":"admin"
        }
    }
}
 
    
```

## Misc filters on field

We support the following additional field-based filters on API responses:

- `not_*`
- `like_*`
- `min_*`
- `max_*`
- `nmin_*`
- `nmax_*`
- `having_*`
- `having_min_*`
- `having_max_*`

Example:

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/placement?like_[fieldName]=partialValue'
```

## Search

Some services support `search` as a query string parameter to look for ID or name. For example:

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/placement?search=17'
```

## Sorting

To sort use the `sort` query string parameter and pass in a list of fields you'd like to sort by and whether you want them ascending (`asc`) or descending (`desc`). For example:

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/campaign?advertiser_id=1&sort=id.desc'
```

## Paging

To page, use the `start_element` and `num_elements` parameters. If `num_elements` is not supplied, it defaults to 100 (which is also the maximum value).

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/campaign?start_element=20&num_elements=10'
```

## Append on `PUT`

By including `append=true` in the query string of a `PUT` call, a user can update only a particular child object instead of replacing all child objects. In other words, rather than overwriting an entire array with a new one on a `PUT` call, you can use `append=true` on the query string to add a single element to a long array.

In this example, we'll use `append=true` on a `PUT` call to toggle the `is_available` flag of an object in the `member_availabilities` array of the [Plugin Service](./plugin-service.md). Without the `append=true` flag on the query string, the new item would replace the entire array. In this example, it's only added.

First let's look at the object we'll be modifying (these examples use [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/issues) to slice and dice the [JSON](http://json.org/)). Both of the availabilities are set to `true`:

We'll send the following [JSON](http://json.org/) to turn off the `is_available` flag on one of the `member_availability` objects:

```
$ cat plugin-update.json
{
    "plugin" : {
        "developer" : {
            "id" : 1
        },
         "member_availabilities" : [
            {
                "is_available" : false,
                 "id" : 4
            }
        ],
         "name" : "ccc"
    }
}
```

Normally, sending the [JSON](http://json.org/) above on a `PUT` call would overwrite the whole `member_availabilities` array. However, this time we'll add `"append=true"` to the query string of the call. This tells the API to change just the object whose `id` is `4`. We can verify that it's done so by inspecting the output.

```
$ curl -bc -X PUT -d @plugin-update.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/plugin?id=13&append=true' | jq '.response.plugin.member_availabilities'
[
  {
    "is_available": false,
    "id": 4
  },
  {
    "is_available": true,
    "id": 7
  }
]
```

## JSON basic structure

Below are the syntax of the components of a [JSON](http://json.org/) object and what they mean.

An object:

```
{. . . }
```

An array:

```
[. . . ]
```

A string:

```
". . ."
```

Associate a key with an alphanumeric string value:

```
"key":"string"
```

Associate a key with a numeric value:

```
"key":int
```

An example that puts them together:

```
{
    "campaign": {
        "name": "my campaign",
        "id": 1434,
        "creatives": [
                {
                    "id": 4162,
                    "state": "active"
                }
            ],
}
}
```

## JSON field types

`POST` and `PUT` requests require [JSON](http://json.org/) data. For `PUT` requests, only the [JSON](http://json.org/) fields included in a request will be updated. All other fields will be unchanged.

Different fields require different types of values. The table of types below extends those defined in the [JSON standard](http://json.org).

| Type | Description | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| boolean | True or false. | `true` |
| string(100) | A string of 100 characters or less. | `"Homepage Pixel"` |
| int | An integer. | `87` |
| decimal | A generic decimal number. | `3.0` |
| float | A floating-point number with 32-bit precision. | `3.14`... |
| double | A floating-point number with 64-bit precision. | `3.14`... |
| enum | One of a number of predetermined values. | `"male"` or `"female"` |
| money | A floating-point numeric value used to represent money. | `19.23` |
| timestamp | A date and time string in the form YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. All timezones are in UTC unless otherwise noted. | `"2009-01-14 05:41:04"` |
| date | See timestamp above. |  |
| object | A wrapper for any sub-fields under the current field. In the example that follows, the field `"brand"` is a multi-object. | See [example for object type](#example-for-object-type) below. |
| array | A list containing one or more values. In our API, arrays most often contain lists of objects, integers, or strings. |See [example for array type](#example-for-array-type) below  |

### Example for object type

```
"brand": {
"id": 466,
"name": "PKR"
}
```

### Example for array type

```
"members" : [
{
"id": 1234,
"member_use_deal_floor": true,
"member_ask_price": 2.15,
"name": "Buyer 1"
},
{
"id": 5561,
"member_use_deal_floor": true,
"member_ask_price": 2.25,
"name": "Buyer 2"
}
]
```

## How and why reporting APIs are different?

The reporting APIs available via the [Report Service](./report-service.md) work differently than our other APIs. They have their own multi-step request and response flow. This is required because they process large amounts of data; this processing needs to be performed asynchronously.

For instructions on how to retrieve reports, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md).

For a tutorial that explains how to use our reporting APIs effectively, see [Report Pagination](./report-pagination.md).

## A note on underscores and hyphens

JSON fields and values use underscores, e.g., `audit_type_direct`.

API service names in URLs are hyphenated, e.g., `https://api.``appnexus``.com/insertion-order`.

## Response codes

All API Services return [JSON](http://json.org/) data. When Service calls are successful, the [JSON](http://json.org/) response will include a `"status"` field set to `"OK"`. The response to `POST` and `PUT` calls will also include the ID of the relevant object, as well as any relevant attributes of that object. Every response includes a `"dbg_info"` object that conveys information about the API call and response that is for Xandr internal use only and may be requested during a support inquiry.

## Error messages

When invalid input is sent to the API (for example, an incorrect password), a [JSON](http://json.org/) response will be returned with `"error"` and `"error_id"` fields.

```
$ cat auth
{
  "auth": {
     "username":"user1",
     "password":"Wr0ngP@ss"
  }
}
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @auth 'https://api.appnexus.com/auth'
{
    "response": {
        "error_id": "NOAUTH"
        "error": "No match found for user\/pass",
        "dbg_info": {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

The `"error"` field is useful for debugging purposes, as it contains a verbose description of the error. The `"error_id"` field can be used programmatically as described in the table below.

| Error_ID | Meaning | How to Respond |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `INTEGRITY` | A client request is inconsistent; for example, a request attempts to delete a default creative attached to an active placement. | Check the request logic for consistency. |
| `LIMIT` | The user has reached the maximum number of allowed objects of a certain type. | Delete unnecessary objects to get under the limit. If you cannot delete any object, please contact your Xandr representative. |
| `NOAUTH` | The user is not logged in, or the login credentials are invalid. | Use the [Authentication Service](./authentication-service.md) to get a token, or check the username and password in your request. |
| `NOAUTH_DISABLED` | The user's account has been deactivated. | Login with a different user, or create a user account specifically for API access. |
| `NOAUTH_EXPIRED` | The user's password has expired and needs to be reset. | Use the [Authentication Service](./authentication-service.md) to get a new token. |
| `SYNTAX` | The syntax of the request is incorrect. | Use the `"error"` message to identify the issue and fix the code. |
| `SYSTEM` | A system error has occurred. | Contact your Xandr representative. |
| `UNAUTH` | The user is not authorized to take the requested action. | Check the `"error"` message and make sure the logic in your code is correct. |
