The **Seller Pod Analytics** **report** shows metrics for groups of ads (aka pods) delivered sequentially in between segments of non-commercial video programming.

You can use this report to determine the following:

- The number of pods that were sent for Monetization
- The average number of impressions sold per pod
- The average estimate of revenue per pre-roll in comparison to mid-roll pod
- The average seconds sold per pod
- The fill rate in seconds
- The number of opportunities to serve impressions if a pod was unfilled

## Time frame

All dates and times are given in UTC.

The `report_interval` field in the JSON request can be set to one of the following:

- custom
- today
- yesterday
- last_7_days(not including today)
- month_to_date
- last_month
- quarter_to_date

To run a report for a custom time frame, set the `start_date` and `end_date` fields in your report request. For more details about these fields, see [Report Service](./report-service.md).

## Example

### Create the JSON-formatted report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` of `"seller_pod_analytics_report"`, as well as the `columns` (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filters for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the `"format"` in which the data should be returned (`csv`, `excel`, or `html`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md).

```
$ cat seller_pod_analytics_report
 
{
    "report":
    {
        "report_type":"seller_pod_analytics_report",
        "columns":[
            "hour",
            "bidder",
            "clicks"
        ],
        "report_interval":"last_48_hours",
        "format":"csv"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the reporting service

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @seller_pod_analytics_report 'https://api.appnexus.com/report'
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"097f59fc3ab7d02c5d60db42081d9b69"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service

Make a `GET` call with the Report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `{{execution_status}}` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=097f59fc3ab7d02c5d60db42081d9b69'
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report":{
         "name":null,
         "created_on":"2010-05-25 19:19:53",
         "json_request":"{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"seller_pod_analytics_report\",\"columns\":[\"hour\",\"bidder\",
            \"clicks\"}}",
         "url": "report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592"
      },
      "execution_status":"ready"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the Report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and Report ID in the `url` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!TIP]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592' > /tmp/seller_pod_analytics_report.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
