# Seller creative review

Sellers can use Microsoft Monetize Seller Creative Review to review and approve creatives before they serve on seller inventory.

Seller Creative Review lets you make exceptions to your ad quality preferences by only allowing creatives that you approve run on your inventory through specific deals that meet your business requirements. Seller Creative Review only works in concert with deals you specify and can’t be used to enable any creative that would otherwise be blocked by your ad quality preferences from running on open exchange inventory.

Seller Creative Review lets sellers:

- Proactively review and approve buyer creatives before they can serve on the seller’s inventory
- Search and sort creatives to prioritize the ones that unlock the most spend
