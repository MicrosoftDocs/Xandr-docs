# Working with Insertion Orders



Insertion orders allow you to easily manage collections of line items
that may share a common budget, time span, and business terms. Insertion
orders are a standard part of the
<a href="object-hierarchy.md" class="xref">Object Hierarchy</a>. An
insertion order can contain one or more line items. For example, you may
want to set a common budget and billing periods for several line items,
but have each line item target a different region or buy different types
of media.
