#  Microsoft Invest - Update a custom creative template

Although you cannot modify the standard Xandr
creative templates, you can modify the rendering code and macros in your
own custom templates.

> [!WARNING]
> Your changes immediately affect any creatives that are already using the template. If your changes cause these creatives to stop rendering properly, their audit status will be changed to "rejected" and they will stop serving on most third-party inventory.

1. Navigate to the **Creative Templates** screen by clicking **Creative \> Templates**.
1. From the grid, click the custom template that needs to be updated. <br>The **Creative Template Details** pane displays.

1. Click **Edit**.
1. Update any of the following fields:
    1. **Name**: The name of the creative template, which helps buyers identify the creative template when uploading creatives that match this template's media type and format.

       > [!TIP]
       > Be sure to use a name that buyers will easily recognize.

    1. **Media Type**:
        Defines the display style of the creatives that can use the
        template, such as banner.
    1. **Creative Format**: Defines the creative resource type that can use
        this template such as Flash, iframe, or External
        File.
    1. **Template Code**:
        Specifies how the creative should be rendered.

       > [!NOTE]
       > If you include custom macros in the template code, they must begin with the `#`symbol. If you include standard macros in the template code, they must begin with the `$` symbol. Be sure to replace any hard-coded [http://adnxs com/](http://adnxs.com/)references within the **Template Code** field with the `${XANDR_DOMAIN}` macro to ensure that the appropriate domain [http://adnxs com/](http://adnxs.com/) or [adnxs-simple.com](http://adnxs-simple.com/) will be used when the auction takes place.

1. Expand the **Custom macros** section if
    necessary.
1. If no custom macros exist in the **Custom macros** section, or if you want to add more custom macros, click **Add Macros** and do the
    following:

    > [!NOTE]
   > You can add up to 20 custom macros. If the template is being used by any active creatives, you cannot add additional custom macros.

    1. Enter a name for this macro in the **Name** field that buyers will see when they upload creatives that use this template.<br> The **Name** field is limited to a
        maximum of 50 characters.

    1. Select a macro type from the **Type** pull-down menu such as **String** and **True / False**.<br>
     For example, if you select **True / False**, buyers will see the macro name followed by a checkbox.

    1. If you selected **Select from List**, enter a value for **Option 1**.<br>
    To add more options, click **Add another option** and enter the corresponding value.

    1. If you want to require buyers to complete
        the macro when uploading new creatives that use this template,
        click the **Required**
        checkbox.
    1. If you do not want the macro to be
        required, enter the **Default
        Value** that will be used when buyers do not complete the
        macro during creative uploads.
1. Repeat step 6 to add each individual custom
    macro.
1. Update the details
    for any of the existing custom macros if necessary.
1. Click **Save**.
