## Introduction

Leveraging postal codes is a powerful way for advertisers to achieve
highly granular and precise, or *hyperlocal*, targeting. Hyperlocal
targeting is a key factor in driving advertising performance. Because
sellers and curators often want to increase efficiency by targeting the
same set of postal codes across multiple deals, the Postal Code List
feature allows users to easily reuse a predefined list of postal codes.

The Postal Code List feature enables users to:

- create postal code lists (include or exclude) so that a list can be
  used across their deals.
- enable postal code lists (include or exclude) for targeting at the
  deal line item level. The maximum number of postal code lists a deal
  line item can target is 100.



Note: Certain legitimate ZIP or postal
codes are unrecognizable or invalid within the
Xandr geography targeting system. This can
happen because <a href="https://www.digitalelement.com/" class="xref"
target="_blank">Digital Envoy</a>, a Xandr
partner that handles geolocation data, can't recognize a ZIP or postal
code's existence until an IP address (user) has been associated with it.
Postal codes that don't exist in the system often represent obscure or
otherwise small geographical zones with minimal internet activity.







## Manage Postal Code Lists

You can create a Postal Code List at the Member
level. A Postal Code List may contain one or more postal codes. Postal
codes can be added to multiple Postal Code Lists. However, a postal code
can be added only once to a single Postal Code List.

Postal codes can be added to a list by either:

- Copying and pasting in a dialog box.
- Bulk uploading a CSV, Excel, or Text file.

The maximum number of postal codes allowed in a list is 100,000.





Note: For USA, you can target the full
9-digit postal code (also known as zip +4). For example, "10010-7456".





**Create a New Postal Code List:**

1.  Select
    Audiences
    \>  Location Manager.
2.  On the Location Manager page,
    select
    New
    \>  Postal Code List.
3.  Provide the following details in the
    Create A Location Target page:
    1.  Name: Enter the name of the
        Postal Code List. For example, enter "NetherlandsLoc1". The
        maximum number of characters allowed is 255.
    2.  Code: (optional) Enter a code
        for the Postal Code List.
    3.  Description: (optional) Enter
        a description for the Postal Code List that gives a brief
        definition of the postal code location target. For example,
        enter "Postal Code List for Noor-Holland region in the city of
        Amsterdam, Netherlands".
4.  Click Next.
5.  On the Location Target
    Features page, select one of the following options:
    - **Copy and Paste**: If you select this option, on the next page
      you can enter the postal codes to include in the Postal Code List.
      The codes need to be separated by a comma or hard return. When
      you're done, click Next.
    - **Import from file**: If you select this option, on the next page
      you can browse for and upload a CSV, Excel, or Text file that
      contains the postal codes. Once uploaded, click
      Next.

    

    Note: You need to select the
    country to which the postal codes belong before using the **Copy and
    Paste** or **Import from file** option. You can only upload postal
    codes from one country at a time. For USA, you can target the full
    9-digit postal code (also known as zip +4). For example, you can
    target "10010-7456".

    
6.  On the Review Location Target
    page, the following tabs are available:
    - Successfully Imported displays
      the list of postal codes that were successfully imported to the
      Postal Code List with the Code,
      Country Name,
      Country ID of each postal code.
    - Did Not Import displays postal
      codes that failed to import properly.
7.  Click Save to complete the setup.
