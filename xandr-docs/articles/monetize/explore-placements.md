### Intervals

Use the dropdown at the top right of the screen to choose the interval for the data that is displayed for each placement:

- **Today**: Current calendar day up to the last hour.
- **Yesterday**: Full 24-hour period of the previous calendar day.
- **Last 7 Days**: Full 7 days previous to the current calendar day, i.e., excluding today.
- **Lifetime**: Entire lifetime of each line item, including the current calendar day.

### Currency

Click the Currency dropdown to select the currency units to display for all monetary values in the grid. You can select either USD (United States Dollars) or the publisher's currency.

[Currency Support](currency-support.md) for more information on currencies.)

### Time zone

Click the **Time Zone** dropdown to select a time zone. This will be the time zone that is used to determine the data collected for the specified interval (**Toda**y,

### Filtering

You can filter your list of placements by name or by ID. Click the **Filter** button and type any part of the name or ID, then click **Apply filter**.
The filter will return placements matching the filter only within the selected placement group. It will not return placements from other placement groups.

Click **Reset** to remove the filter and display all placements within the selected placement group.

### Assigning a default creative to the placement
