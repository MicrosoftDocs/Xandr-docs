# Microsoft Monetize - Applying media types and templates to banner creatives

You can apply media types and standard Microsoft Advertising and custom templates to your banner creatives from the **Create New** screen.

You can apply the following media types to your banner creatives:

| Media Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Banner | Static media that typically takes the form of an image. |
| Expandable | Rich media that can be enlarged beyond the initial dimensions of the placements they fill on web pages. |
| High Impact | Dynamic media that is scalable and contains rich media attributes. |
| Interstitial | Transitional media that appears as a user navigates through multiple web pages. |
| Skin | Transformative media that is embedded into the background of a web page. |

After selecting the appropriate media type, you can search for and select standard Microsoft Advertising and custom templates. For more information about how to create a custom creative template, see [Create a Custom Creative Template](create-a-custom-creative-template.md).
