# Seller CMP Analytics Report





The Seller CMP Analytics Report provides insight into the number,
validity, and content of the IAB Transparency & Consent Framework (IAB
TCF) strings on seller ad requests to Xandr
endpoints. This report enables sellers to answer questions like:

- How many ad requests contained TCF strings encoded according to the
  TCF v1 or v2 specifications?
- How many ad requests contained TCF strings that were not encoded
  properly and therefore invalid or malformed?
- Is my CMP (Consent Management Platform) correctly passing permission
  information to Xandr?

This report does not prove or disprove compliance with any laws or
regulations. The language "GDPR applied" for this report means,
Xandr applied TCF logic.
Xandr supports the IAB TCF and this report
enables sellers using the TCF to confirm that TCF signals are
communicated properly.

For ad requests where TCF logic is applied the classification is
summarized in this diagram:

<img src="../images/seller-cmp-analytics/seller-cmp-analytics.png"
class="image" />

Sellers wishing to have all of their ad requests treated according to
the IAB TCF standards and policies can force application of
Xandr TCF logic by passing 'gdpr=1' according to
the IAB OpenRTB Spec. If the GDPR parameter is omitted but the request
includes a TCF string via URL params, Xandr will
apply TCF logic (unless the impression is received via OpenRTB). For
impressions received via OpenRTB, the
Regs.ext.gdpr field must be set to
**1** in order for Xandr to apply TCF logic.

A high number of present but malformed strings for a given publisher
usually means that the publisher's CMP is not creating or encoding the
strings according to TCF specifications, and therefore are unreadable to
Xandr and other vendors. Unreadable strings,
because they do not provide clear signals to vendors, are treated as no
permission for any vendor, and should be avoided.

To Run Your Report

Follow these steps to run your report.

1.  Select Reporting from the
    appropriate top menu (depending on how your account has been
    configured).
    1.  Or, from the Publishers top menu, click on
        Prebid
        Server Premium \>
        Analytics \>
        Prebid Server Analytics
2.  Select the relevant report from the list. The
    Report screen shows the available
    filters, dimensions, and delivery options for the report. The
    selections you make here will determine what report data is
    delivered to you, and how.
    

    Important: For an explanation of
    how grouping and filtering work, see
    <a href="dimensions-metrics-filtering-and-grouping.html"
    class="xref">Dimensions, Metrics, Filtering, and Grouping</a>.

    
3.  Select the relevant filters to limit the data displayed to just the
    information you want. For example, rather than running a report that
    shows impressions for all inventory sources, you may want to list
    results for just a select few. When you select a filter (by clicking
    Edit), a selection panel appears.
    Select items in the **Available** list (left), then click
    Add to include them in the
    **Chosen** list (right).
4.  Group by Dimension. Grouping allows you to display rows of data in
    the order you prefer.
    

    Warning: The more dimensions you
    group by, the larger the data set that is returned. Larger data sets
    can take substantially longer to process. Be sure to group using
    only the dimensions you need.

    
5.  Choose a delivery option. Once you've selected your filters and
    grouped by your chosen dimensions, you need to choose a delivery
    method. Available delivery methods include:
    - **Run now, show results in screen**: For smaller amounts of data,
      you may want to view the report as soon as possible in your
      browser. You can download the report in XLSX, CSV, Excel/TSV and
      JSON format. However, there is a limit of 100,000 rows per report
      when downloading as XLSX and Excel file.
    - **Run in background, notify me when results are ready to view**: A
      popup notification will let you know when the report is ready to
      view or download.
      

      Tip: The maximum size of the
      report that can be downloaded from the UI is 100 MB. Also, there
      is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when downloading as XLSX and
      Excel file. If the size of the report is more than that, you can
      try to download it using the <a
      href="https://docs.xandr.com/bundle/xandr-api/page/report-service.html"
      class="xref" target="_blank">API</a> for that reporting service
      (The limit here is 10 million rows).

      
    - <span id="ID-000057f2__d10e107">**Export, send results via
      email**: Run the report in the background and email the results to
      one or more email addresses.
    - **Save as report template**: Save your selected report settings so
      that you can run this report again in the future. You can name
      this template using the text entry field under
      Name this report (its checkbox
      is auto-selected when you choose this option). A saved report can
      be rerun from the Your Reports
      screen.
    - **Add to scheduled reports**: Run this report automatically at
      specified times and have it sent to one or more email addresses.
    - **Name this report**: Give this report with its current settings a
      name for future reference.
6.  <span id="ID-000057f2__d10e136">Click Run
