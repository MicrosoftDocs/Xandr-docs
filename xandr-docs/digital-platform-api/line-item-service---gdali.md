# Line Item service - GDALI

> [!NOTE]
> This page describes the Line Item Service for a Guaranteed Delivery Augmented Line Item (GDALI). While a GDALI uses the same line item service and endpoint as other types of line items (for example, [Line Item Service - ALI](line-item-service---ali.md)), there are a number of required fields that have to be configured properly to get the expected GDALI behavior.
>
> To create a GDALI, you must set the `line_item_subtype` field to "`gd_buying_imp"` or `"gd_buying_exclusive"`, and associate the line item with a seamless insertion order via the `insertion_orders` array. For more information, see [Insertion Order Service](insertion-order-service.md).

A line item defines your financial relationship with an advertiser, including budget, revenue type, and inventory targeting.

A GDALI is typically used for direct-sold business when an arrangement has been secured from a buyer with a committed impression volume, and is designed to:

- Deliver budget in full across its flight dates.
- Deliver budget evenly across its flight dates.
- Optionally compete in the auction with other demand, such as RTB/Open Exchange, while guaranteeing the original delivery goal.

| `flat_fee_type` | string | Flat fees can be paid out daily or on the flight end date. Available values are:<br>- `one_time`: The fee will be paid on the final allocation date. The associated `revenue_value` is the value to be paid on that date. The flight cannot be longer than one month.<br>- `daily`: The fee will be paid daily. The associated `revenue_value` is the daily fee, *not* the fee for the entire flight.<br>**Default:** `one_time`<br>**Required On:** `POST`/`PUT` if `revenue_type` is `"flat_fee"`.<br>Migration Notes: NO CHANGE |

### Supply strategies

The `supply_strategies` object is used to designate which supply source you wish to target when buying inventory.

> [!NOTE]
> When `"line_item_subtype"` is set to `gd_buying_imp` or `gd_buying_exclusive`, the `supply_strategies` field may be omitted.
> [!CAUTION]
> The values of this object's boolean fields supersede the setting of the `inventory_type` field. Once any of these fields are set to `true` on an ALI, the `inventory_type` field will be ignored and unsettable for that line item. If you attempt to make a `PUT` call on the value of the `inventory_type` field after one or more of these fields have been set to `true`, the following error message will be generated: `"inventory_type cannot be updated once supply_strategies has been set"`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `managed` | boolean | Designates whether you wish to target managed inventory. This only includes inventory managed by your network. |
| `rtb` | boolean | Designates whether you wish to target inventory on the Open Exchange. This includes all third-party inventory not managed by your network that has been enabled for reselling (including external supply partners such as Microsoft Advertising Exchange and Google Ad Manager). |
| `deals` | boolean | Designates whether you wish to target deal inventory. This includes any deals which you are are eligible to bid on. |
| `programmatic_guaranteed` | boolean | Designates whether you wish to target a programmatic guaranteed deal with this line item. If this is set to `true`, then the `rtb`, `managed`, and `deals` fields must be set to `false`. |

#### Target managed inventory

```
$ cat LI-supply-strategies.json

{
    "line-item": {
      ...
      "supply_strategies": {
          "managed": true,
          "rtb": false,
          "deals": false,
          "programmatic_guaranteed": false
      }
      ...
    }
}
```

### Delivery goal

The `delivery_goal` array contains information about the delivery goal attached to the GDALI. GDALIs will attempt to deliver against impression or percentage goals.

In order for GDALIs to serve, there are a number of different validations that have to be performed. The validations change depending on the type of delivery goal (see `type` field below).

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `id` | int | The unique, automatically generated ID of this delivery goal. |
| `type` | string | The type of delivery goal. Allowed values:<br> - `"impressions"`: GDALIs with impression goals will attempt to serve the specified number of impressions evenly across their flight dates. If the delivery goal `type` is `"impressions"`, lifetime budget must be set at the line item level.<br>- `"percentage"`: Currently, the percentage goal is only available for `"exclusive"` GDALIs.<br><br>**Note:** If the delivery goal `type` is `"percentage"`, the line item cannot have a budget. |
| `disallow_non_guaranteed` | boolean | When `true`, this line item will always serve over non-guaranteed line items participating in the same (managed) auction.<br><br>**Note:** For exclusive delivery type, we recommend setting this field to `true` to ensure delivery. For impression guaranteed line items, setting this field to `true` may impact competition in the auction, which could impact yield. |
| `percentage` | int | If the type of delivery goal is `"percentage"`, this is the actual percentage at which the GDALI will serve. Allowed values are integers 0 <= n <= 100. If the delivery goal's `type` is `"impressions"`, this field must be `null`. |
| `reserved` | boolean | **This is a required field.** When `true`, this line item has inventory `"reserved"` for it; in other words, the line item is set to purchase a guaranteed number or percentage of impressions on a seller's inventory during its flight.<br><br>**Note:** You will not be able to set a GDALI's `state` to `"active"` unless this field is set to `true`. |
| `guaranteed_delivery_version` | int | **Deprecated.** This field is no longer in use. |

#### Apply a delivery goal to an exclusive guaranteed line item

```
$ cat LI-exclusive-delivery.json

{
    "line-item": {
      ...
      "line_item_subtype": "gd_buying_exclusive",
      ...
      "delivery_goal": {
          "type": "percentage",
          "percentage": 100,
          "disallow_non_guaranteed": true,
          "reserved": true
      }
      ...
    }
}
```

#### Apply a delivery goal to an impression guaranteed line item

```
$ cat LI-imp-delivery.json

{
    "line-item": {
      ...
      "line_item_subtype": "gd_buying_imp",
      ...
      "delivery_goal": {
          "type": "impressions",
          "disallow_non_guaranteed": false,
          "reserved": true
      }
      ...
    }
}
```

### Flat fee

The `flat_fee` object contains the following fields.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `lat_fee_status` | enum | **Read-only.** The status of the flat fee disbursement. Possible values: `"pending"`, `"processing"`, `"allocated"`, or `"error"`. |
| `flat_fee_allocation_date` | timestamp | The date when the flat fee revenue is scheduled to be allocated to publishers. <br>**Example:** `"2019-06-08 00:00:00"`.<br>This value will be `null` if the `flat_fee_type` is `daily`. |
| `flat_fee_adjustment_id` | int | **Read-only.** The ID for any adjustments required to this flat fee. |

#### Apply a daily $100 flat fee to a line item

```
$ cat LI-daily-flat-fee.json

{
    "line-item": {
      ...
      "revenue_value": 100,
      "revenue_type": "flat_fee",
      “flat_fee_type”: “daily”,
      ...
    }
}
```

#### Apply a one-time flat fee to a line item

```
$ cat LI-one-time-flat-fee.json

{
    "line-item": {
      ...
      "revenue_value": 10,
      "revenue_type": "flat_fee",
      "flat_fee_type": "one_time",
      ...
      "flat_fee": {
          " flat_fee_allocation_date": "2020-12-01 00:00:00"
      }
      ...
    }
}
```

### Budget schedule setting

The `budget_scheduling_settings` contains the following field.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `underspend_catchup_type` | enum | Dictates how Xandr's system deals with an underdelivered daily budget. Use the `"evenly"` value if you'd like the unspent portions of your budget to be spent evenly throughout the rest of flight, or `"ASAP"` if you'd like the unspent budget to be spent as soon as possible.<br>Possible values: `"evenly"` or `"ASAP"` (default). |

### Roadblock

The `roadblock` object contains information to enable the delivery of two or more creatives to the page in unison. Roadblocks can be applied only for managed inventory and can't be enabled when you're working with third-party inventory.

GDALIs support "page-level" roadblocks, where one impression is recorded for the full set of creatives delivered for the roadblock. Impressions are recorded based on delivery of the master creative; if the master creative doesn't serve, no impression will be recorded. Budgets are based on master impressions delivered, exclusive of companion delivery.

> [!NOTE]
> The `master_width` and `master_height` fields must be defined for roadblock line items. The master creative is the creative with a size matching the `master_height` and `master_width` specified in the `roadblock` object. If more than one creative matches that size, the system will choose one as the master.
>
> Video roadblock line items are identified by the slot position and not the ad size `master_width` and `master_height` of the master creative. This is because the ad size is set to 1x1 for all videos.
>
> To serve a roadblock, one creative for each size must be eligible to serve on the page. All creatives will serve if ad slots are available. If more than one creative per size exists, creatives will rotate through a single ad slot. There can be more ad slots available than there are creatives to fill them.

For more on roadblocking, see [Target Your Inventory with Roadblocking](../monetize/target-your-inventory-with-roadblocking.md).

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `type` | enum | The type of roadblock. For GDALIs, this value must be either:<br>- `null`: (default) There is no roadblocking set at the line item level.<br>- `partial_roadblock`: Enables roadblocking on the line item. The line item serves when at least one creative of each size fits an eligible ad slot. |
| `master_width` | int | The width of the master creative. This value is required when roadblock type equals `partial_roadblock`. **Note**: For all video ad types, the width must be set to `1`. |
| `master_height` | int | The height of the master creative. This value is required when roadblock type equals `partial_roadblock`. **Note**: For all video ad types, the height must be set to `1`. |
|`slot_type` |string|The slot position of the master creative. Possible values are: `"AD_POD_FIRST"` (First Slot), `"AD_POD_LAST"` (Last Slot), `"INTRO_BUMPER"`, `"OUTRO_BUMPER"`.|

#### Apply a partial roadblock to a line item

          "master_height": 600
          "ad_types": "banner"
      }
      ...
    }
}
```

#### Apply a partial roadblock to a line item with video ad type

```
$ cat LI-roadblock.json

{
    "line-item": {
      ...
      "roadblock": {
          "type": "partial_roadblock",
          "master_width": 1,
          "master_height": 1,
          "ad_types": "video",
          "slot_type": "AD_POD_FIRST"
      }
      ...
    }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `id` | int | The unique identifier for this advertiser. |
| `name` | string | The name of the advertiser associated with the unique ID above. |

### Labels

You can use the read-only [Label Service](label-service.md) to view all possible labels for line items, advertisers, insertion orders, and publishers. This service also allows you to view the labels that have already been applied to your objects.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `id` | int | The ID of the label. Possible values: `7`, `8`, `11`. |

| `id` | int | The ID of the conversion pixel. |
| `state` | enum | The state of the pixel. Possible values: `"active"` or `"inactive"`. |
| `post_click_revenue` | double | The post click revenue value for the pixel. This field can only be set when the line item's `revenue_type` field has been set to `cpa` (as a result, this field can't be used with augmented line items). |
| `post_view_revenue` | double | The post view revenue value for the pixel. This field cab only be set when the line item's `revenue_type` field has been set to `cpa` (as a result, this field can't be used with augmented line items). |

| `trigger_type` | enum | **Read-only.** The type of event required for an attributed conversion. <br>Possible values: `"view"`, `"click"`, or `"hybrid"`. |

### Insertion orders

> [!NOTE]
> **Insertion Orders for Guaranteed Delivery Augmented Line Items (GDALI)**
>
> For an insertion order to be associated with a Guaranteed Delivery Augmented Line Item (GDALI), the insertion order must:
>
> - Be a [Seamless Insertion Order](insertion-order-service.md) (legacy insertion orders are not compatible).
> - Have `budget_type` set to `impression`.
> - Not contain more than one `budget_intervals` array.
> - Have unlimited budget (set via the `budget_intervals` array).
>
> Insertion orders not matching the above may only be associated to non-guaranteed line items.
>
> The above criteria is also required for programmatic guaranteed line items (PGLI). An insertion order with the above settings may also be associated to non-guaranteed line items.
>
> Associating a `profile_id` (e.g., frequency capping or setting additional targeting) on the insertion order object may result in unexpected forecasting or delivery for PGLIs and GDALIs. It is recommended not to use `profile_id` for insertion orders intended for the use with GDALIs.
>

For a list of supported currencies, see the [Currency Service](currency-service.md).<br><br>**Note:** For best results, set the currency on the parent insertion order. For more information, see [Insertion Order Service](insertion-order-service.md). |
> | `budget_intervals` | array of objects | The metadata for the budget intervals from the associated insertion order. Budget intervals enable multiple date intervals to be attached to an insertion order, each with corresponding budget values. For more information, see [Insertion Order Service](insertion-order-service.md). |

### Auction event

The following fields are contained within the `auction_event` object.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Guaranteed delivery line items only support impression and view-based auction events.
> - Omitting the `auction_event` object (or setting to `null`) results in the line item tracking revenue/payment based on impression events.
> - Do not supply values for the fields within this object that end in `_code` or `_id`. Only supply values for the fields in the `auction_event` object that end in `_type`. The object will return the fields ending in `_code` and `_id`, but they will be ignored on `POST` and `PUT` calls.
>
> For Viewable CPM, set:
>
> - `revenue_auction_event_type` field to `"view"`- Use this value when your Revenue Type is Viewable CPM. Only measured viewable impressions will be counted, according to the Xandr viewability measurement, using the IAB definition.

### Budget intervals

When creating a new guaranteed delivery line item, ensure that the `start_date` and `end_date` of each of its `budget_intervals` array objects fall within one of the budget intervals defined on the parent insertion order (insertion orders are associated with line items via the `insertion_orders` array in the Line Item Service).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Although budgets of any size may be configured on the line item, setting a lifetime budget with an equivalent daily impression budget of 1,000 impressions or less may result in the line item spending its lifetime budget prior to its designated end date.
> - If the parent insertion order's `budget_type` field has been set to `"impression"` *and* the line item's `auction_event` field has been set to Viewable CPM, only the viewable impressions count against both line item and insertion order budgets.
> - The `parent_interval_id` (in the `budget_intervals` array) has been deprecated and its value will be ignored.

Also consider the following when using the `budget_intervals` array:

- A guaranteed delivery line item must not contain more than one `budget_intervals` array.
- Impression guaranteed line items ("`line_item_subtype`": "`gd_buying_imp`") require a value be set for `lifetime_budget_imps`, as well as `lifetime_pacing` set to `true`. All revenue budget fields must be set to `null`. Setting `daily_budget_imps` in addition to `lifetime_budget_imps` may impact delivery; best practice is to only set the `lifetime_budget_imps` field.
- Exclusive line items ("`line_item_subtype`": "`gd_buying_exclusive`") must omit all budget fields, or set to `null`.

Each object in the `budget_intervals` array contains the following fields.

| Field | Type (Length) | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `id` | int | The ID of the budget interval. |
| `start_date` | timestamp | The start date of the budget interval. Format must be `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss` (hh:mm:ss should be hh:00:00). |
| `end_date` | timestamp | The end date of the budget interval. Format must be `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss` (hh:mm:ss should be set to hh:59:59). Must not be `null` for guaranteed delivery line items. For delivery to work best, your budget intervals should have a duration of at least 4 hours. |
| `timezone` | string | The timezone by which budget and spend are counted. For a list of acceptable timezone values, see [API Timezones](api-timezones.md). |
| `parent_interval_id` | int | **Deprecated.** The value of this field will be ignored. Instead, use the `start_date` and `end_date` fields of this array to define when the line item should run. |
| `lifetime_budget` | double | The lifetime budget in revenue for the budget interval. The revenue currency is defined by the `currency` field on the `insertion_order` object.<br><br>**Note:** If you also set the `lifetime_budget_imps` field in this array, whichever budget is exhausted first will cause spending to stop. A GDALI should only have `lifetime_budget_imps` defined. |
| `lifetime_budget_imps` | double | The lifetime budget in impressions for the budget interval.<br><br>**Note:**<br>- If you add line items to this insertion order, any spend already associated with those line items before they are added to the insertion order is NOT counted against the lifetime budget of the insertion order. Only spend that occurs while the line item is a child of the insertion order is counted.<br>- If you also set the `lifetime_budget` field in this array, whichever budget is exhausted first will cause spending to stop. A GDALI should only have `lifetime_budget_imps` defined.<br>- When a line item is enabled for roadblocks, only master creative imps will count against `lifetime_budget_imps`. |
| `lifetime_pacing` | boolean | If `true`, the line item will attempt to pace the lifetime budget evenly over the budget interval. If `true`, you must set `lifetime_budget` or `lifetime_budget_imps`. |
| `lifetime_pacing_pct` | double | A double integer between-- and including-- 50 and 150, used to set pacing throughout a budget interval. Possible values can be any double between 50 and 150 on the following scale:<br>- `50`: Pace behind schedule.<br>- `100`: Pace evenly.<br>- `150`: Pace ahead of schedule.<br><br>**Note:** It's recommended to set this field to `105`. By default, the value will be set to `100`. |
| `daily_budget` | double | The daily budget in revenue for the budget interval. The revenue currency is defined by the `currency` field on the `insertion_order` object.<br><br>**Note:**<br>- If you add line items to this insertion order, any impressions associated to those line items when they are added to the insertion order are NOT counted under the lifetime budget of the insertion order. Only impressions that occur while the line item is a child of the insertion order are counted.<br>- If you also set the `daily_budget_imps` field, whichever budget is exhausted first will cause spending to stop. Best practice is to only set one of these fields. |
| `daily_budget_imps` | double | The daily budget in impressions.<br><br>**Note:** If you also set the `daily_budget` field, whichever budget is exhausted first will cause spending to stop. Best practice is to only set one of these fields. |
| `enable_pacing` | boolean | If `true`, then spending will be paced over the course of the day. Only applicable if there is a `daily_budget`. |
| `creatives` | array | Specifies the creatives associated with this budget interval. In order to serve, creatives must also be specified in the line item `creatives` field and `all_budget_intervals` must be `false`. |

#### Apply budget interval to a line item

```
$ cat LI-budget-intervals.json
 
{
    "line-item": {
      ...
      "budget_intervals": {
          "start_date": “2020-08-01 00:00:00”,
          "end_date": “2020-08-31 23:59:59”,
          "timezone": "UTC",
          "lifetime_budget_imps": 150000,
          "lifetime_pacing": true
      }
      ...
    }
}
```

### Stats

> [!NOTE]
> The `stats` object has been **deprecated** (as of October 17, 2016). Use the [Report Service](report-service.md) to obtain statistical information instead.

### First run and last run

To include the `first_run` and `last_run` fields in a `GET` response, pass `flight_info=true` in the query string. You can also filter for line items based on when they first and last served, as follows:

#### Retrieve only line items that have never served

Pass `{{never_run=true}}` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&never_run=true'
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can use `{{never_run=true}}` in combination with other filters, but note that it will always be an OR relationship. For example, if you pass both `{{never_run=true}}` and `{{min_first_run=2012-01-01 00:00:00}}` in the query string, you will be looking for line items that have never served OR line items that first served on or after 2012-01-01.

#### Retrieve only line items that first served on or after a specific date

Pass `{{min_first_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS}}` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&min_first_run=2012-01-01 00:00:00'
```

#### Retrieve only line items that first served on or before a specific date

Pass `{{max_first_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS}}` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&max_first_run=2012-08-01 00:00:00'
```

#### Retrieve only line items that first served within a specific date range

Pass `{{min_first_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS&max_first_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS}}` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&min_first_run=2012-01-01 00:00:00&max_first_run=2012-08-01 00:00:00'
```

#### Retrieve only line items that last served on or after a specific date

Pass `{{min_last_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS}}` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&min_last_run=2012-01-01 00:00:00'
```

#### Retrieve only line items that last served on or before a specific date

Pass `{{max_last_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS}}` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&max_last_run=2012-08-01 00:00:00'
```

#### Retrieve only line items that last served within a specific date range

Pass `{{min_last_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS&max_last_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS}}` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&min_last_run=2012-01-01 00:00:00&max_last_run=2012-08-01 00:00:00'
```

Fields of the type date can be filtered by `nmin` and `nmax` as well. The `nmin` filter lets you find dates that are either null or after the specified date, and the `nmax` filter lets you find dates that are either null or before the specified date.

## Examples

### View all of an advertiser's line items

> [!NOTE]
> If an advertiser has only one line item, it will be returned via the `{{line-items}}` JSON array.

```
$ curl -b cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?advertiser_id=3872575'
{
    "response": {
        "count": 3,
        "line-items": [
            { ..."id": 12954413,...},
            { ..."id": 4983291,...},
            { ..."id": 4983258,...}
        ]
    }
}
```

### Update a line item end date

In this example, we are updating the end date of a line item.

```
$ cat line_item_end_date_update.json

{
    "line-item": {
        "budget_intervals: [
            {
                "end_date": "2020-12-31 23:59:59"
            }
        ]
    }
}

curl -b cookies -X PUT -d @line_item_end_date_update.json "https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?id=12954413&advertiser_id=3872575"
```

### Update a line item reserve property to true

In this example, we are updating the reserve property of a line item to true. For more details, see [Delivery Goal](#delivery-goal).

```
$ cat line_item_reserve.json
{
    "line-item": {
        "delivery_goal: {
            "reserved": true
        }
    }
}

curl -b cookies -X PUT -d @line_item_reserve.json "https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?id=12954413&advertiser_id=3872575"
```

### Create a GDALI with impression delivery model and CPM revenue type

1. Create a GDALI JSON (you'll need an existing insertion order ID and advertiser ID).

    ```
    $ cat gd_imp_cpm
    
    {
    "line-item": {
        "name": "Test-GDALI",
        "advertiser_id": "3872575",
        "insertion_orders": [{"id": 4971824}],
        "line_item_subtype": "gd_buying_imp",
        "state": "inactive",
        "priority": 14,
        "ad_types": [
          "banner"
        ],
        "timezone": "UTC",
        "budget_intervals": [
          {
            "start_date": "2020-10-01 00:00:00",

            "timezone": "UTC",
            "lifetime_budget_imps": 150000,
            "lifetime_pacing": true,
            "lifetime_pacing_pct": 105
          }
        ],
        "currency": "USD",
        "revenue_type": "cpm",
        "revenue_value": 1,
        "delivery_goal": {
          "type": "impressions",
          "disallow_non_guaranteed": false,
          "reserved": true
        }
      }
    }
    ```

1. Make a `POST` request to the **`https://api.appnexus.com/line-item`** endpoint using this GDALI JSON and the appropriate `advertiser_id`.

    ```
    $ curl -b cookies -X POST -d @gd_imp_cpm.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?advertiser_id=3872575'
    
    {
        "response": {

### Create a GDALI exclusive line item with daily flat fee revenue

1. Create a GDALI JSON (you'll need an existing insertion order ID and advertiser ID).

    ```
    $ cat gd_exclusive_flat
    
    {
    "line-item": {
        "name": "Test-flat fee-GDALI",
        "advertiser_id": "3872575",
        "insertion_orders": [{"id": 4971824}],
        "line_item_subtype": "gd_buying_exclusive",
        "state": "inactive",
        "priority": 14,
        "ad_types": [
          "banner"
        ],
        "timezone": "UTC",
        "budget_intervals": [
          {
            "start_date": "2020-10-01 00:00:00",
            "end_date": "2020-10-31 23:59:59",
            "timezone": "UTC"
          }
        ],
        "currency": "USD",
        "revenue_value": 100,
        "revenue_type": "flat_fee",
        “flat_fee_type”: “daily”,
        "delivery_goal": {
          "type": "percentage",
          "percentage": 100,
          "disallow_non_guaranteed": true,
          "reserved": true
        }
      }
    }
    ```

1. Make a `POST` request to the **`https://api.appnexus.com/line-item`** endpoint using this GDALI JSON and the appropriate `advertiser_id`.

    ```
    $ curl -b cookies -X POST -d @gd_exclusive_flat.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?advertiser_id=3872575'
    
    {
        "response": {

### Create a GDALI roadblock line item

1. Create a GDALI JSON (you'll need an existing insertion order ID and advertiser ID).

    > [!NOTE]
    > The impression budget for GDALIs with roadblocks enabled represents *master* creative delivery only.

    ```
    $ cat gd_roadblock
    
    {
    "line-item": {
        "name": "Test-Roadblock-GDALI",
        "advertiser_id": "3872575",
        "insertion_orders": [{"id": 4971824}],
        "line_item_subtype": "gd_buying_imp",
        "state": "inactive",
        "priority": 14,
        "ad_types": [
          "banner"
        ],
        "timezone": "UTC",
        "budget_intervals": [
          {
            "start_date": "2020-10-01 00:00:00",
            "end_date": "2020-10-31 23:59:59",
            "timezone": "UTC",
            "lifetime_budget_imps": 150000,
            "lifetime_pacing": true,
            "lifetime_pacing_pct": 105
          }
        ],
        "currency": "USD",
        "revenue_type": "cpm",
        "revenue_value": 1,
        "roadblock": {
            "type": "partial_roadblock",
            "master_width": 300,
            "master_height": 600
        },
        "delivery_goal": {
          "type": "impressions",
          "disallow_non_guaranteed": false,
          "reserved": true
        }
      }
    }
    ```

1. Make a `POST` request to the **`https://api.appnexus.com/line-item`** endpoint using this GDALI JSON and the appropriate `advertiser_id`.

    ```
    $ curl -b cookies -X POST -d @gd_roadblock.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/line-item?advertiser_id=3872575'
    
    {
