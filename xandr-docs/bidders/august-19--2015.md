# August 19, 2015

> [!WARNING]
> Due to issues with our recent release, we have performed an emergency rollback to version 1.15 of the Impression Bus API. As a result, the default `https://api.adnx.com` and `https://api.adnxs.com/current` endpoints currently point to version 1.15.
> 
> We will rollout version 1.16 again on September 28, 2015. In the meantime, clients who want to use version 1.16 can point to it in their calls, e.g., `https://api.adnxs.com/v1.16/creative`. Clients who still need to adjust to the breaking changes in version 1.16 can find information about required changes in our [June 16, 2015](june-16--2015.md) release notes.

We are pleased to announce the following enhancements to version 1.16 of the AppNexus ImpBus API.

## End of breaking change period

This release includes the breaking changes that were announced in our [June 16, 2015](june-16--2015.md) release notes. It is the end of the 60-day period during which we continue to support the earlier version of the API, as stated in our [Breaking Changes Policy](breaking-changes.md). The `https://api.adnxs.com` endpoint now points to version 1.16 .

## Retrieving report data

When you request a report via the [Report Service](report-service.md), we first return a Report ID. You then make a `GET` call with that Report ID to check the status of the report. In the past, if the report was ready, the response to this `GET` call would include the report data. Going forward, however, you must make a subsequent `GET` call with the Report ID to the `report-download` service to retrieve the report data. For step-by-step instructions, see [How to Retrieve a Report](report-service.md#how-to-retrieve-a-report).
