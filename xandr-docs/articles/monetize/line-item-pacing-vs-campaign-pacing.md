# Line Item Pacing vs. Campaign Pacing



Pacing allows you to evenly spread your budget over the course of a day
or an entire line item or campaign, thereby
minimizing the risk of overspending your budget in a very short period
of time. The primary ways to assign pacing are at the **Line Item**
level and at the **Campaign** level. While there are many advantages to
using pacing at both levels, there are potential problems that must be
considered. This document describes certain methods and procedures that
will allow you to get the most out of pacing without unintended
ramifications.

What is Pacing?

Pacing is the method by which the system determines how to spend the
designated budget (or number of impressions) so that impressions serve
evenly throughout over a specified period (a period can be a day or it
can be the life of the campaign or line item). This method can be used
if you wish to serve impressions for part of the day (called
**dayparting**) or for the entire day.

You can set pacing when you are creating either a new **Line Item** or
Campaign (or even at the insertion
order level).



<b>Note:</b> The budget allocation and pacing
of your line item will be determined based on the flight dates of the
underlying campaigns. As a result, we recommend that you have campaigns
running for the entire duration of the parent line item's billing
periods/flight dates.



When Should I Use Line Item Level Pacing?

This method takes all of the campaigns under it into consideration when
setting the pacing. This pacing technique allows you to control the
budget of all of the campaigns in the line item as a whole. If you
aren't concerned with the specific performance of individual campaigns,
but you do need the line item to serve evenly, you should use this
method. Note that you will not control which campaigns will use more of
the line item budget and which will use less. Pacing at the line item
level is based on **Revenue** or
Impressions.

When Should I Use Campaign Level Pacing?

You should use this method when you want to control the budget of each
individual campaign. While this may involve more work during setup, it
is more accurate and has the added benefit of ensuring proper pacing at
the line item level (assuming all campaigns pace correctly). Pacing at
the campaign level is based on **Cost** or
Impressions.

Best Practice Recommendations

Xandr makes the following suggestions regarding
pacing:

Resist Pacing at Multiple Levels

In most cases, the benefits of pacing can be recognized by setting it at
either the line item level **or** the campaign level. Setting it at both
levels can be unnecessary and potentially result in uneven or under
delivery. Daypart campaigns are a perfect example of this - the line
item budget will attempt to pace that campaign across all 24 hours,
while the campaign will pace only during the hours it is supposed to
serve. These conflicting settings can lead to underspend or massive
spend spikes.

There are a few rare cases where pacing at multiple levels has benefits,
but if you are not certain as to why you are setting both levels, choose
one or the other.

Set Pacing at the Campaign Level First

As a general rule, pacing should be done as specifically as possible to
apply the greatest level of control. Therefore, you should always try to
apply pacing to the campaign level first. Only if you cannot meet your
pacing goals at the campaign level should you try to apply it at the
line item level.

Ensure That You Target Adequate Inventory

If your campaign targets limited inventory (perhaps you have defined a
very small segment or a very specific inventory source), daily pacing
might limit your opportunities to serve to the point that it is
practically impossible for you to spend anywhere near your daily budget.
Ensure that you have an adequate inventory source so that your campaign
can win enough auctions to spend properly.
