# Activate Nielsen Sales Impact for a line item

At $0.55 CPM for served impressions, you can activate Nielsen Catalina Solutions' (NCS) Sales Impact measurement for your augmented line item. Sales Impact lets you analyze your line item's performance in influencing offline purchases among your target audience.

1. Go to the **Measurement** section.

1. Enable **Sales Impact**.

    >[!Note]
    >Only impressions with an associated user ID will incur a $0.55 CPM. Impressions without an ID aren't measurable and thus don't incur a fee.

1. Designate a **Report On** level for generated sales attribution reports:

   |Option  |Description  |
   |---------|---------|
   |**Line Item Level**     |Generates sales attribution reports showing data for your line item         |
   |**Split Level**     |Generates sales attribution reports showing data for your line item's splits         |

1. Search for and select a **Product Group**.

    **Product Group** searches are used to narrow down what **Category**, **Brand**, or **Product** you want to measure your Sales Impact performance against. **Product High** is synonymous with a product line (example: Coca-Cola beverages), and **Product Low** is synonymous with a product line's specific product (example: Diet Coke or Diet Cherry Coke).

    >[!Tip]
    >If you want to measure a **Category** as a whole, select the row in which only the **Category** is displayed. If you want to measure a **Brand**, select the row in which only the **Brand** is displayed. Follow the same pattern for a **Product High** and **Product Low**.

1. Select a **Report Request Frequency** option:

    **Report Request Frequency** determines when you'll start receiving Sales Impact data reports for your line item and how often new  reports will be made. Data shown in the reports is based on your **Report On** selection in **Step 4**.
    - **Weekly**: You'll receive a weekly data report on Tuesdays until the line item is completed.
    - **Once Per Flight**: You'll receive a data report at the end of each flight.

1. Select a **Report Range** option:

    **Report Range** determines how much line item data is shown in each generated report (based on your **Step 6** selection). Data shown in the reports is based on your **Report On** selection in **Step 4**.
    - **Lifetime**: Reports will show cumulative data starting from a flight's start date and ending two days before a report's request date (request dates are always on Tuesdays). For example, a report requested (generated) every Tuesday would show Sunday as the end date for its reported data.

      >[!Tip]
      >Choose this option if you want to analyze your line item's cumulative performance in every report.

    - **Seven Days**: Reports will show data from a seven-day time span that ends two days before a report's request date (request dates are always on Tuesdays). For example, a report generated every Tuesday would show Sunday as the end date for its reported data.

      >[!Tip]
      > Choose this option if you want to analyze how your line item's Sales Impact performance is changing from week to week.
