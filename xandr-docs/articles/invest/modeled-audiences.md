# Modeled Audiences




<b>Note:</b> This feature is currently in
Alpha. It is still under development and may be subjected to changes
without notice. To enable this feature, contact your
Xandr Account Representative.





Modeled Audience is a feature available for Xandr
Invest that allows advertisers to take their first-party segments
and expand them to similar users for targeting. For first-party seed
segments, Xandr gathers auction data such as
geographic information, device type, and inventory URL.
Xandr uses this data and machine learning
algorithms to find more users with similar characteristics as those
within the first-party segment. These users are then added to the new
modeled audience segment.



## Modeled Audience Requirements

Before you create a modeled audience, make sure:

- The advertiser-owned first-party segments and pixels have over 18,000
  daily active users.
- The line item's minimum duration is 30 days.




## Set Up a Modeled Audience

1.  In the Invest DSP UI, select the line item
    for your advertiser.
2.  Click Edit and select the
    Audience & Location Targeting
    option on the left pane.
3.  An Audience and Location
    Segments panel is displayed on the right. Now, click on
    Create Modeled Audience from the
    targeting model.
4.  Select a Seed Segment from the
    dropdown menu.
    

    <b>Note:</b> Only eligible seed segments
    are shown in the dropdown menu.

    
5.  Select one of the Segment Reach
    options for the modeled segment:
    - More Precise: Includes
      approximately the top one-third (1/3) of the users in the modeled
      segment.
    - Balanced: Includes approximately
      the top two-thirds (2/3) of the users in the modeled segment.
    - More Reach: Includes all the
      users in the modeled segment.
6.  Click on Save Modeled Segment to
    save your modeled segment. The newly generated segment model will be
    available within the next 48-72 hours, along with its estimated
    size.





<b>Note:</b> **Alpha release restrictions:**

- Legal disclosure policies have not been updated yet. Hence, modeled
  segments will no longer include users from the EU. This may be
  subjected to changes in the future.
- A modeled audience can only be created and edited in the line item
  view.
- Modeled audiences are not supported for data marketplace or
  third-party segments.
- The seed segment must be in the same member seat as the modeled
  audience segment.
- Only one modeled audience can be targeted per line item.
- Only one segment can be used as the seed for a modeled audience.
- The seed segment must be an advertiser-owned first-party segment.
- The start date of the line items are used to determine when to start
  modeling.
