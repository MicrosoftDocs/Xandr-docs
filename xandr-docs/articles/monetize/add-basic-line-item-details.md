# Add Basic Line Item Details



You can set the name, state, and ad type, as well as associate
additional insertion orders to the line item, all from the
Basic Settings section. You can
also optionally assign an external code.



1.  Enter the name that you will use to search for
    and report on the line item.
    

    The name of the line item must be unique per advertiser.

    
2.  Click +External
    Code and enter a code if you want to report on a line item
    using your own code (rather than the internal ID that
    Xandr assigns automatically).
    

    External codes must follow these guidelines:
    - They can contain only alphanumeric characters, periods,
      underscores or dashes.
    - Codes are not case-sensitive (upper-case and lower-case characters
      are treated the same).
    - No two objects can use the same code per advertiser. For example,
      two line items cannot both use code "ABC."

    
3.  Set the
    State.
    

    We recommend that you set the state to
    Inactive until everything on the
    buyside has been set up and verified. Therefore, spending won't
    occur until you're ready.
    

    Note: If a user's settings require
    them to receive approval before activating a line item, a banner
    message will display stating that peer approval is required.

    

    
4.  Associate additional insertion orders to the
    line item by doing the following:
    1.  Click the pencil icon above the existing
        insertion order that displays.
        

        A list of corresponding insertion orders displays automatically.

        
    2.  Search for additional existing insertion
        orders if necessary.
    3.  Select the corresponding check marks to
        associate the necessary insertion orders that display.
        

        You won't be able to select particular insertion orders if their
        billing periods overlap or conflict with the billing periods of
        the insertion order that was previously associated to the line
        item.

        
    4.  Click
        Save.
5.  Leave Banner
    selected as the Ad Type or select
    a different option.
    

    The ad type must match the creative types that you will associate
    with the line item. This setting determines how auction items are
    tracked for the line item's buying strategy, payment strategy,
    optimization options, creative association, and targeting options.
