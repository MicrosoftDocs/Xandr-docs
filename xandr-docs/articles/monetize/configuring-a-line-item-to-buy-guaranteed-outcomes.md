# Configuring a Line Item to Buy Guaranteed Outcomes



Guaranteed outcomes are only available on Augmented Line Items (ALI).
When creating an ALI to buy guaranteed views or completes, use the
settings under Basic Setup.

To configure a line item to buy Guaranteed Views:

1.  Under Ad Type, select Banner or
    Video.
2.  Under Revenue Type, select Cost
    Plus or Viewable CPM.
3.  Under Supply Strategy, select Open
    Exchange and/or **Deals**.
4.  Under Payment Model, select Pay per
    View. For more information about which viewability standards
    you can choose, see
    <a href="supported-viewability-standards-for-guaranteed-outcomes.md"
    class="xref">Supported Viewability Standards for Guaranteed Outcomes</a>.

To configure a line item to buy Guaranteed Completes:

1.  Under Ad Type, select Video.

2.  Under Revenue Type, select Cost
    Plus or CPCV.

3.  Under Supply Strategy, select Open
    Exchange and/or **Deals**.

4.  Under Payment Model, select Pay per
    Complete.

    After your Payment Model is configured, the line item is all set to
    bid and accrue media cost on an outcome basis (vCPM for Views and
    CPCV for Completes) instead of an impression (CPM) basis. See
    <a href="reporting-on-guaranteed-outcomes.md" class="xref">Reporting
    on Guaranteed Outcomes</a> for information on how to report on
    Guaranteed Outcomes-based ALIs.
