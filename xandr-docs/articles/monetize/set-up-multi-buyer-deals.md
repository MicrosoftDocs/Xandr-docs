# Set Up Multi-Buyer Deals



You can set up Multi-Buyer Deals in two different ways: 1) multi-buyer
deals with multiple buyers across various DSPs and 2) bidder-level deals
with all buyers on a DSP.



<div class="li stepsection">

From the Deal section of the
Basic Setup section (see
<a href="create-a-deal-line-item.html" class="xref">Create a Deal Line
Item</a>):



1.   Click Edit
    under Buyers to open the
    Buyer Targeting screen.
    

    

    The Buyer Targeting screen has
    the following tabs:
    - DSPs – lists individual DSPs
      (bidders) that support bidder-wide deals. Click the
      “\>” after the DSP to display
      the list of buyers on that DSP. You can search for DSPs by name
      and ID. (DSP Name corresponds to
      Bidder Name. DSP ID corresponds
      to Bidder ID.)
    - Buyers – corresponds to members
      or seats, depending on which the DSP is using (see
      <a href="understanding-buyer-seat-ids.html" class="xref"
      title="Buyer Seat IDs allow external DSPs to use proprietary buyer IDs for the buyers they manage, rather than using a Xandr member ID. If a DSP has implemented this feature, you can choose between member and seat IDs when creating a deal and reporting on buyers.">Understanding
      Buyer Seat IDs</a>). You can search for buyers by name and ID (for
      seat buyers, Buyer Name
      corresponds to Seat Name, Buyer
      ID corresponds to Seat Code, and
      DSP Name corresponds to Bidder
      Name)

    

    
2.  Click either the
    DSPs or
    Buyers tab to enable the following
    configurations:
    1.  To set up bidder-level deals with all
        buyers on a DSP, click the
        DSPs tab to display available
        DSPs that use their own seat IDs for buying on a deal and click
        the green check mark to include any.
    2.  To set up a multi-buyer deal with multiple
        buyers across various DSPs, you can either:

    - Click the Buyers tab to display
      available buyers and click the green check mark to include any.
    - Click the DSPs tab to display
      available DSPs, click the “\>”
      after the DSP to display the list of buyers on that DSP, and click
      the green check mark to include any.

    

    

    Note: Not all DSPs or buyers will
    be selectable; DSPs need to be enabled by
    Xandr for multi-buyer deals on an individual
    basis based on their support for the feature. For any DSP that does
    not support multi-buyer deals, you can still include one buyer from
    that DSP on a broader multi-buyer deal. If you think a DSP you’re
    setting up a deal with should support multi-buyer deals, please
    contact your account representative.

    

    
3.   Click Save.
