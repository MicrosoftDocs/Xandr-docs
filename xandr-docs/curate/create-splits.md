# Microsoft Curate - Create Splits

Supply Shaping allows you to optimize your curated deals by defining specific splits and settings.

Follow the steps below to configure Supply Shaping effectively:

1. From the **Supply Shaping** panel, click the toggle to enable Supply Shaping for your curated deal. The splits entry grid will appear.
1. From the **Targeting** dropdown, select which targeting criteria you want to define for your splits. This will add a column to the entry grid from which you can configure the targeting for each split.
1. Select a split to display the action bar, allowing you to:
    1. Move a split higher or lower in the priority order.
    1. Deactivate a split if it is not needed temporarily.
    1. Delete a split if itâ€™s no longer needed at all.
1. Click the **New** button to add more splits to the entry grid.
1. Use the checkboxes at the top of the entry grid to define further settings for your splits. These settings are described in the following sections.
1. Click the **enable catch-all** toggle to turn on the catch-all split. See the [Introduction to Splits](intro-to-splits.md) page for more information about the catch-all split.
