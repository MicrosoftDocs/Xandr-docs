# Enable Cross-Device Targeting and Measurement for a Line Item



You can optionally enable the cross-device targeting and measurement
feature on a line item to apply frequency caps, conversion attribution,
and audience targeting settings for individual users across multiple
devices.


The Cross-Device pull-down menu
appears in the Audience & Location
Targeting section. It is disabled by default.



<b>Note:</b> Cross-device targeting carries a
cost-per-mille (CPM) or cost-per-thousand-impressions charge, which is
noted next to the name of the identity provider you select.
Xandr clears this charge with the data provider,
and it is included in your total costs in reporting.





<b>Warning:</b> Cross-device functionality is
available to sellers when running line items that purchase inventory
from the ad exchange using RTB. It's not available when sellers are
running managed campaigns on their own inventory.

targeting works, see

To enable cross-device tracking and measurement,
select the identity graph you want to use to connect users across
devices.

  Xandr continues to invest in enriching the

When the line item starts running, the selected device graph will be
applied for frequency capping purposes, conversion attribution, and
audience extension.
