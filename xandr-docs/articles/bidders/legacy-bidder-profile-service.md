# Legacy Bidder Profile service

Bidder Profiles are used to create and manage filtering criteria for which real-time [Bid Requests](outgoing-bid-request-to-bidders.md) you wish to receive. Profiles allow you to limit resources required to process unwanted bid requests. See the [Bidder Profile - FAQ](bidder-profile---faq.md).

## Important notes

- For a bid request to pass a bidder profile, the bid request must meet ALL of the specified filter criteria.
- You may create multiple profiles for your bidder, but **only one** parent profile can be **active** for your bidder at any given time. Activate a profile by associating it with your bidder, using the [Bidder Service](bidder-service.md).
- Your bidder will always receive bid requests for inventory that is owned by a member associated with your bidder. Bidder profiles are not applied in this case.
- Data Provider bidders can only have one parent profile and no child profiles.

> [!WARNING]
> Profiles must be attached to an active bidder object.
>
> After you create a profile, you must attach the profile to your bidder by specifying "parent_profile_id" via the [Bidder Service](bidder-service.md).
>
> Do not use deprecated fields.
>
> Do not include any of the fields marked as deprecated below when you are configuring your profile(s). This will lead to your bidder not receiving the expected volume of bid requests.
>
> Frequent profile updates may temporarily lock that profile.
>
> If you make multiple updates to a bidder profile within 30 minutes, the profile can potentially get locked as a safety precaution. If a profile gets locked, traffic matching only this profile will not go through for approximately 5 minutes.

## Supported filtering criteria

The following filtering criteria are currently supported:

- Selling Member
  - Specify whether to require or exclude inventory from members, see the [Platform Member Service](platform-member-service.md).

| GET | https://api.adnxs.com/profile/BIDDER_ID | **View Profiles:** To see all of the profiles attached to your bidder. |
| GET  | https://api.adnxs.com/profile/BIDDER_ID/PROFILE_ID | **View Profiles:** To see a specific profile attached to your bidder. |
| POST | https://api.adnxs.com/profile/BIDDER_ID<br>(profile JSON) | Add a Profile for your bidder. |
| PUT  | https://api.adnxs.com/profile/BIDDER_ID/PROFILE_ID<br>(profile JSON) | Modify an Existing Profile. |
| DELETE | https://api.adnxs.com/profile/BIDDER_ID/PROFILE_ID<br><br>**Note:** Only inactive profiles can be deleted; that is profiles that are not associated with the bidder object. | Delete an existing profile. |
|  | Use the [Bidder Service](bidder-service.md) to set the `profile_id` field on the bidder to the id of the desired bidder profile. | Activate a profile for your bidder as the parent profile. |
|  | Use the [Bidder Service](bidder-service.md) to update the child_profiles array on the bidder to include id of the desired bidder profile. | Activate a profile for your bidder as a child profile. |

## JSON fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `ID` | String | Unique identifier for the bidder profile.<br>**Required:** Yes, on update. |
| `code` | String | Alternative identifier for the bidder profile, specific to the bidder.<br>**Required:** No. |
| `description` | String | Description of the bidder profile.<br>**Required:** No. |
| `last_activity` | timestamp | The timestamp of the last modification to the profile.<br>**Required:** No. |
| **Bid Throttling** |  |  |
| `passthrough_percent` | double | The percent (50 = 50%) of bid requests which satisfy your profile targeting that you wish to receive. Requests that are sent to your bidder are randomly chosen, although you can choose for your bidder to always receive requests for users in segments of members associated with your bidder. If you set passthrough_percent to 0, your bidder will only receive requests for users in at least one of your members' segments. These values take effect in increments of 0.1.<br>**Required:** No. |
| **Member Filtering** |  |  |
| `member_targets` | Array of Objects | Array of objects that include the member ids of members. The default action, if no action is specified, is "include" - meaning the member IDs must be included. This may be overridden by specifying an "action" in the object, e.g. "member_targets":[{"id":"100","action": "exclude"}]. For more details, see [Platform Member Service](platform-member-service.md). <br>**Required:** No. |
| **Geography Filtering** |  |  |
| `country_action` | Enum - "exclude" or "include" | If "exclude", only bid requests for countries NOT in "country_targets" will be sent to the bidder. If "include", only bid requests for countries in "country_targets" will be sent to the bidder. Default is exclude.<br>**Required:** No. |
| `country_targets` | Array of Objects | The country IDs to be either excluded or included, as defined by the `country_action` field. You can use the [Country Service](country-service.md) to retrieve a list of country IDs. For more details and format, see [Country Targets](#country-targets).<br>**Required:** No. |
| `region_action` | Enum - "exclude" or "include" | If "exclude", only bid requests for regions NOT in "region_targets" will be sent to the bidder. If "include", only bid requests for regions in "region_targets" will be sent to the bidder. Default is exclude.<br>**Required:** No. |
| `region_targets` | Array of Objects | The region/state IDs to be either excluded or included, as defined by the region_action field. You can use the [Region Service](region-service.md) to retrieve a list of region IDs. For more details and format, see [Region Targets](#region-targets).<br>**Required:** No. |
| `dma_targets` | Array of Objects | Array of objects specifying the dmas to be targeted (for inclusion or exclusion). E.g. [{"dma":123}, {"dma":124}]<br>**Required:** No. |

| `city_targets` | Array of Objects | The IDs of cities to be either included or excluded, as defined by the city_action field. You can use the [City Service](city-service.md) to retrieve a list of city IDs. For more details and format, see [City targets](#city-targets).<br>**Required:** No. |
| `city_action` | Enum - "exclude" or "include" | If "exclude", only bid requests for cities NOT in "city_targets" will be sent to the bidder. If "include", only bid requests for cities in "city_targets" will be sent to the bidder. Default is exclude.<br>**Required:** No. |
| **Inventory** |  |  |
| `inventory_action` | Enum - "exclude" or "include" | Deprecated. Please leave it as "exclude" and don't use this field, as this can reduce the available inventory sent to your bidder.<br>**Required:** No. |
| `use_inventory_attribute_targets` | Boolean | If set to "true", then inventory_attribute_targets will be applied. This flag allows you to "opt-in" to receive certain inventory attributes, such as toolbars, if they exist for a piece of inventory. If "false", the bidder will receive all inventory. <br>**Required:** No. |
| `inventory_attribute_targets` | Array of [inventory attribute](inventory-attribute-service.md) objects. | An array of objects for the targets to include, e.g. [{"id":12}]. If use_inventory_attribute_targets is enabled, we will send bid requests that contain the selected attributes. We will also send bid requests that contain no inventory attributes. To exclude a particular inventory attribute, simply include all the IDs except for the attribute you wish to exclude.<br>**Required:** No. |
| `non_audited_url_action` | string | If this is set to "exclude", all inventory that has not been audited by Xandr will be excluded. Otherwise, all inventory will be included.<br>**Required:** No. |

| `segment_boolean_operator` | Enum - "and" or "or" | Action to apply to the segment_targets. "And" means all of the criteria must be satisfied.
