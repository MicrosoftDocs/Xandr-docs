# TinyTags



This page provides an overview of how TinyTags work. For more details,
see the <a
href="https://docs.xandr.com/bundle/xandr-bidders/page/tinytag-service.html"
class="xref" target="_blank">TinyTag Service.</a>



## Overview

A publisher creates a TinyTag ID via the TinyTag Service or with
Xandr assistance. The TinyTag ID can either be
used to create an ad tag which is placed on an inventory page, or simply
stored server side and referenced during ad calls. The most basic form
of a TinyTag is: <a href="https://ib.adnexus.com/tt?id=123" class="xref"
target="_blank">https://ib.adnexus.com/tt?id=123</a> where "123" is the
TinyTag ID.

When an inventory page loads, the ad call pings
Xandr's impression bus. If necessary, the
impression bus references the server-side TinyTag ID. It then looks up
any information associated with the tag, such as minimum acceptable
reserve price and a reserve creative. The impression bus sends bidders
the appropriate user and webpage information from the tag and asks for
their bids in 1/20th of a second (50 ms).

One of four things then happens:

1.  The advertiser with the highest bid wins the auction and their
    creative is returned to the webpage.  
2.   The reserve price or some other criteria is not met, no one wins,
    and the default creative is returned.  
3.   No one wins and the default creative daisy chains the ad call to a
    third-party adserver. The third party takes full control and the ad
    call does not return to Xandr.  
4.  If the TinyTag uses the <a
    href="https://docs.xandr.com/bundle/xandr-bidders/page/preemptive-tags.html"
    class="xref" target="_blank">Preemptive Tags</a> feature, the ad
    call passes to a third party. It may or may not return to
    Xandr.





## TinyTag ID

Each impression that runs through Xandr will be
associated with an ID generated by the <a
href="https://docs.xandr.com/bundle/xandr-bidders/page/tinytag-service.html"
class="xref" target="_blank">TinyTag Service.</a>, the TinyTag ID, or
with assistance from Xandr personnel. Each
TinyTag ID is associated with a unique publisher and carries information
such as:

- Reserve price
- Default creative
- Size
- Ad profile (for example, what creatives are not allowed)

This TinyTag information is stored server-side at
Xandr; this means that once a tag is in place,
you will never have to re-tag a publisher page again. You can modify the
tag data server side.

The default creative is a "backup" if any parameters, such as the
reserve price, were not met. It is important to note that the default
creative can be a literal creative, say an in-house ad, OR it can be a
redirect in the form or a third-party ad tag to third party adserver.





## The Ad Call: Dynamic Parameters

Parameters can also be added to the TinyTag at the time of the ad call.
Please see <a
href="https://docs.xandr.com/bundle/xandr-bidders/page/dynamic-tinytag-parameters.html"
class="xref" target="_blank">Dynamic TinyTag Parameters</a> for details.
