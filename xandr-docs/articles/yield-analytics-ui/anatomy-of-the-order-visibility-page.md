# Anatomy of the Order Visibility Page



The Order Visibility page on
the Orders tab shows basic information
about the order, as well as the order lines it contains. Click an order
line's name to display its Order Line
Visibility page. This shows the order line's flighting and
delivery, as well as any competing order lines.



## About the Order Visibility Page

There are several sections on the Order
Visibility page:

- Header - Displays the order line name, order status, and underdelivery
  warning (if applicable). The header also contains the following
  functions:
  - Date range filter - Specify a standard or custom time period.
    Lifetime data (the range between the start and end dates) is
    displayed by default. Data on the screen automatically updates based
    on the dates you select.
  - Export drop-down list - Export data and/or charts into the following
    formats:
    - Complete report (.xls) - Excel file of complete line details,
      performance charts, filters, and sources.
    - Chart (.xls) - Excel file containing performance chart data.
    - Chart (.png) - .png image file of the chart, as it appears on
      screen at the time of export.
    - Chart (.pdf)  -  .pdf image file of the chart, as it appears on
      screen at the time of export.
  - Actions drop-down list
    - Add to Scenario - Available only if you use Scenario Manager. View
      how changing the order line's priority affects related products.
    - View in Reports - View order line information on
      the Reports tab.
- Order details panel - Displays the latest details for the order. Data
  in this section is not affected by filters elsewhere on the
  screen. Click the down arrow next to the panel heading to expand and
  collapse as needed.
  - Basics - Displays basic information about the order. This includes
    the order name, flight dates, order line ID, order and advertiser
    links, industry, and salesperson.
- Dashboard – Displays a quick overview of order performance
  with metrics you commonly use for order analysis. Wherever applicable,
  both lifetime and date range values are displayed for each metric, so
  you can easily compare information. These values are automatically
  updated based on the date range you select in the header, and
  color-coded to match the performance chart. The following metrics are
  displayed in the dashboard:
  - Contracted Revenue
  - Earned Revenue
  - Contracted Impressions
  - Scheduled Impressions
    - Consumed Impressions
    - eCPM
    - Pacing
    - C:S %
    - Revenue Against Goal
    - Delivered Clicks
    - Click Thru Rate



Note: If a metric appears in the
dashboard, but not in the performance chart, it may appear in red text.

- Performance chart - Displays a graphic chart of the order's
  performance based on revenue or impressions. You can change the chart
  by selecting a group (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly),
  and metric (impressions, revenue, or clicks). The horizontal axis
  displays the flight date range, whereas the vertical axes reflect the
  metric you selected. Data is color-coded for easy analysis and matches
  the colors in the dashboard section. When you mouse over any data
  point on the chart, a tool tip is displayed that describes the metric
  data. A green vertical line on the graph represents the
  historical/forecast boundary. 
- Order Lines – Displays a summary or expanded view of all lines in the
  order. If you choose to view cancelled lines, these lines will be
  included in metric data in the Dashboard and Performance chart. Order
  lines projected to underdeliver are flagged with a warning.

## Reporting on Orders

If you use the Reports tab, click the
Advertiser name in the order Basics panel to open a
pre-configured report to analyze the order. For consistent reporting,
the Dashboard uses the same metrics that are available in
the Reports tab.
