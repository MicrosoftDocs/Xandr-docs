# Overlap Types



Overlap types represent the hierarchical relationship between two
products as follows:

- Parent – Product that entirely contains (i.e., is a full superset of)
  another product. 
- Child – Product that is entirely contained within (i.e., is a full
  subset of) another product. 
- Sibling – Product that partially overlaps with another product. 
- Twin – Two products that contain/describe the exact same set of
  inventory.

## Example of an Overlap

The following example shows these overlap types in action.

- Parent: Section=Sports – The Section=Sports product is a parent to the
  Section=Football product because Section=Football product is entirely
  contained within it. 
- Child: Section=Football – The Section=Football product is a child of
  the Section=Sports product because it's entirely contained within
  Section=Sports. 
- Sibling: Geo=NY – The Geo=NY product is a sibling to the
  Section=Sports product because the two products partially overlap. 
- Twin: Content Category=Sports – The Content Category=Sports product is
  a twin to the Section=Sports product because they both contain exactly
  the same set of inventory.
