# Buy-Side Reporting on Deals





Once you've started buying deals, you can run reports to analyze how
your deals are performing.

- **Network Analytics**  
  The
  <a href="network-analytics-report.md" class="xref">Network Analytics
  Report</a> lets you view deal performance, revenue, and profit data
  across multiple advertisers.
- **Advertiser Analytics**  
  The <a href="advertiser-analytics-report.md" class="xref">Advertiser
  Analytics Report</a> lets you view deal performance, revenue, and
  profit data for a specific advertiser.
- **Network Site Domain Performance**  
  The <a href="network-site-domain-performance-report.md"
  class="xref">Network Site Domain Performance Report</a> lets you see
  the domains that deals are serving on across multiple advertisers.
- **Advertiser Site Domain Performance**  
  The
  <a href="site-domain-performance.md" class="xref">Advertiser Site
  Domain Performance report</a> lets you see the domains that deals are
  serving on for a specific advertiser.
- **Partner Center Reporting Link**  
  The
  <a href="partnership-details-screen-buyer-view.md" class="xref">Show
  in Reporting</a> button provides a link between managing your deals in
  the Partner Center and checking on deal performance in the
  <a href="network-analytics-report.md" class="xref">Network Analytics

For each of these reports, you can group by Deal to report on multiple
deals at once, or you can filter by Deal to report on specific deals.
