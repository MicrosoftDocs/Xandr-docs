## Types of Microsoft video inventory

Microsoft offers four types of video inventory that are available
programmatically:

- In-stream (MSN)
- Outstream (MSN)
- Bannerstream (MSN)
- Windows Video Interstitials (Windows)

The following table summarizes the benefits and availability of each
inventory type:

| Inventory Type | Description | Benefits | Targeting Options | Market Availability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bannerstream | Bannerstream was developed by Xandr. It's available on MSN Homepage inventory (with future rollout to other pages). With Bannerstream, buyers have access to an integrated seamless video advertising experience within the MSN Homepage. Bannerstream lets buyers define static "post-show" images that display after the video finishes playing. | - Supports VAST/VPAID video<br> - Provides better publisher control when rendered<br> - Integrates more seamlessly, offering a better user experience<br> - Allows for better tracking of viewability, quartiles, and errors through the Xandr VPAID wrapper | Audience such as profile and behavior | 50+ markets |

The video player only displays when the user navigates to that location. When the user navigates away from that location or the video ad has finished playing, the video player disappears automatically. It is not statically positioned on the page. Microsoft offers these types of ads on MSN Desktop Web article pages. | - Appears dynamically when a user navigates to the ad position on a page<br> - Up to 30 seconds in duration<br> - Audio starts on mouse-over | - Content channels such as auto, news, and finance<br> - Audience such as profile and behavior | 50+ markets |

## Targeting Microsoft video inventory

Each video inventory type can be targeted using RTB or Deals. To target
Microsoft video inventory, follow the guidelines listed in the table
below:

| Targeting Method | Guideline |
|---|---|
| Deals | - Contact your Verizon representatives if you want to target deals in the following markets: US, Canada, UK, Germany, Spain, Italy, France, Brazil, and Japan.<br> - Contact your Xandr account representative if you want to target deals in the following markets: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and all emerging markets. |
| External Bidder | - When targeting msn.com, add **msn.com** to the targeted domain list using the [Inventory List Item Service](../digital-platform-api/inventory-list-item-service.md). All MSN domains will be captured by the parent msn.com domain.<br> - When targeting video bid requests, we highly recommend that bidders listen to the [Video AppNexus Object](../bidders/outgoing-bid-request-to-bidders.md) within the Video Extension Object to distinguish In-stream, Outstream, and Bannerstream bid requests. Without listening to this object, it is difficult to differentiate Bannerstream inventory since Bannerstream is a proprietary Xandr format.<br>**Note**: If you choose to filter by creative size, the list of creative sizes must be exhaustive. Include 1x1 as a permitted size since all of our video inventory appears as 1x1. For more information, see our [Bidder Profile - FAQ](../bidders/bidder-profile---faq.md). |
| RTB | - **For MSN**: In your inventory list, include the **msn.com** domain. For more information, see [Buying MSN Inventory](buying-msn-inventory.md).<br> - **For Windows**: In your inventory list, target **Windows AppNetwork (348882)**. For more information, see [Buying Microsoft Windows 3rd Party AppNetwork Inventory](buying-microsoft-windows-3rd-party-appnetwork-inventory).<br>Depending on market availability, buyers can also target the In-stream and Outstream video position as described in [Video Targeting](video-targeting.md). |
