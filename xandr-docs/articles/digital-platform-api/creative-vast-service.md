# Creative VAST service

You can use the Creative Vast Service to add **video** or **audio** creatives to Xandr. All creatives must be attached to an advertiser or publisher.

- You can view your advertiser ID by calling the [Advertiser Service](advertiser-service.md).
- You can view your publisher ID by calling the [Publisher Service](publisher-service.md).
- You can attach a creative to a publisher for use as a default creative for a placement. You would then attach the creative to a placement via its ID using the [Placement Service](placement-service.md).

> [!NOTE]
> `video_attribute`is always required on the `creative-vast`endpoint.

## Auditing

Xandr works with members who care deeply about brand and reputation. For this reason, we are careful to ensure that the advertisements
(creatives) that pass through our system are acceptable to all parties. For quality assurance, all creatives that serve on third-party inventory must be pre-registered using the Creative Service.

- Creatives are identified by their media_url (either a third-party adserver URL or a Content Delivery Network URL for a Flash or video file).
- Xandr checks media_urls on a regular basis. If a file disappears, the creative will be treated as unaudited.
- Once a creative has passed Xandr audit, certain changes to the creative cause it to be resubmitted for audit. For more details, see [Changes That Cause Re-Audit](#changes-that-cause-re-audit) below.
- For more details on auditing, see [Creative Standards and Auditing](../bidders/creative-standards-and-auditing.md).

## First run/last run

To include the `first_run` and `last_run` fields in a GET response, pass `flight_info=true` in the query string. You can also filter for
creatives based on when they first and last served, as follows:

### Retrieve only creatives that have never served

Pass `never_run=true` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/creative-vast?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&never_run=true'
```

> [!TIP]
> You can use `never_run=true` in combination with other filters, but please note that it will always be an OR relationship. For example, if you pass both `never_run=true` and `min_first_run=2012-01-01 00:00:00` in the query string, you will be looking for creatives that have never served OR line items that first served on or after 2012-01-01.

### Retrieve only creatives that first served on or after a specific date

Pass `min_first_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/creative-vast?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&min_first_run=2012-01-01 00:00:00'
```

### Retrieve only creatives that first served on or before a specific date

Pass `max_first_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/creative-vast?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&max_first_run=2012-08-01 00:00:00'
```

### Retrieve only creatives first served within a specific date range

Pass `min_first_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS&max_first_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/creative-vast?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&min_first_run=2012-01-01 00:00:00&max_first_run=2012-08-01 00:00:00'
```

### Retrieve only creatives that last served on or after a specific date

Pass `min_last_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/creative-vast?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&min_last_run=2012-01-01 00:00:00'
```

### Retrieve only creatives that last served on or before a specific date

Pass `max_last_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/creative-vast?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&max_last_run=2012-08-01 00:00:00'
```

### Retrieve only creatives that last served within a specific date range

Pass `min_last_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS&max_last_run=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` in the query string.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/creative-vast?advertiser_id=100&flight_info=true&min_last_run=2012-01-01 00:00:00&max_last_run=2012-08-01 00:00:00'
```

## Changes that cause re-audit

Once a creative has passed Xandr audit (`audit_status` is `"audited"`), changing any of the following fields causes the creative to be
resubmitted for audit (`allow_audit` is set to `"pending"`).

- media_url
- click_url
- language
- categories
- technical_attributes
- brand_id
- pixel_url
- video_attribute
- media_assets

Also, if the `audit_status` is `"no_audit"`, changing `allow_audit` from `"false"` to `"true"` causes the creative to be resubmitted for Xandr audit.

## Examples

### Upload a video or audio creative

When uploading a creative for hosting with Xandr:

**Step 1: Upload the asset to the [creative upload service](creative-upload-service---file-format.md).**

```
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: hbapi:139072:5761726637ada:nym2" --form "type=video" --form "file=@./Xandr_30_1280_720_2500k.mp4" "https://api.appnexus.com/creative-upload?member_id=123"
```

The **media_asset_id** is returned.
