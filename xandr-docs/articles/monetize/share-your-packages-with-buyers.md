# Share Your Packages with Buyers



As a seller, you can proactively commercialize your packages by sending
links to both Xandr and external buyers. This
page walks you through the process.

Share Packages with Any Buyer

To generate a public link that you can send to any buyer, on
Monetize or off:

1.  Click the Open Public Package
    button.
2.  Copy the URL in the screen that opens. This is the screen the buyer
    will see.
3.  Email it to any buyers who would be interested in your packages.

Share Packages with a Specific Buyer

If you have customized packages for a specific buyer, you can grab a
unique link to send just to that buyer:

1.  Click the Preview Packages button.
2.  On the Packages Preview
    screen, select Select a specific
    buyer, select the buyer, and click
    OK.
3.  Once you're viewing your packages from the buyer's perspective,
    click the Open \<Buyer's\> Catolog
    button.
4.  Copy the URL in the screen that opens.
5.  Email it to the specific buyer.
