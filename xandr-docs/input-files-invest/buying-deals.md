# Buying Deals



A deal is an agreement between a buyer and a seller that provides
special access to inventory and/or data. There are two ways to strike
deals with sellers:

- **<a href="get-deals-from-seller-packages.md" class="xref">Get Deals
  from Seller Packages</a>**: Browse sellers' pre-made combinations of
  inventory and/or data and immediately convert them into deals or use
  them as a jumping-off point for custom deal negotiations.
- **<a href="negotiate-deals-with-sellers.md" class="xref">Negotiate Deals
  with Sellers</a>**: If you don't find packages that meet your needs,
  kick off negotiations for one-off deals with sellers.
