Setting Seller Defaults



<b>Note:</b> Inventory trust settings only
apply to standard line item targeting.



You can establish inventory trust settings for all sellers. Click
Default Settings to open the **Default
Settings** dialog (see
<a href="set-seller-defaults.md" class="xref">Set Seller Defaults</a>
for step-by-step instructions). You can also override these settings for
individual sellers (see
<a href="edit-seller-defaults.md" class="xref">Edit Seller
Defaults</a> for details).

Setting default inventory trust

You can define which portion of an eligible seller's inventory you
trust. There are three trust levels (they are listed here from least
trusted to most trusted):

- Platform-reviewed: Indicates that
  you trust only the inventory that has been audited by the
  Xandr platform. The
  Xandr domain-level platform-review consists of
  categories, sensitive attributes, and intended audience. This is the
  lowest level of trust and offers the fewest options (domains) in which
  to serve impressions, but provides the highest level of assurance that
  ads will not be served on questionable sites.
- Seller-reviewed: This indicates
  that, in addition to all platform-reviewed inventory (above), you also
  trust inventory audited by the seller. This expands the number of
  domains on which an ad can serve, but requires confidence in the
  review process and standards of the seller.
- All: This indicates that you are
  comfortable serving ads on any domain sent to you by this supply
  partner. This allows access to all domains, but expands the
  possibility that an ad will be served on a questionable or
  inappropriate site. This setting should only be used for partners with
  a long history of exemplary activity.



Viewing Sellers

The Sellers tab lists all sellers,
both Monetize members and external suppliers.
Their member name and ID will display along with statistics for each
seller. The **Platform-wide
Avails.** columns will display statistics on all of the seller's
transactions across the platform. The
**Transactions with Seller**
columns will display statistics on your transactions with the seller.
See
<a href="partner-center-screen-buyer-view.md#ID-00000b82__ID-00000c0f"
class="xref">Searching for Sellers</a> to find a specific type of seller
and then review the statistics to determine if you'd like to partner
with the seller.

Platform-wide Avails.

  number of impressions the seller has sold across the entire platform
