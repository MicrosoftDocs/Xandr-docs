# Supply Type Targeting



Supply Types (**App & Web**, **App Only**, or
Web Only) can be targeted via the
Inventory Type field in the
Inventory and Brand Safety section of
the line item setup (see
<a href="create-an-augmented-line-item-ali.html" class="xref"
title="You create augmented line items (ALIs) to define your financial relationship with an advertiser, set up targeting for an advertising campaign, and schedule your advertisements to run.">Create
an Augmented Line Item</a>).

To restrict the placement types where your creatives may run, select the
**Set custom supply type** checkbox and set the relevant supply toggles
to **OFF**:

- **Web Placements** - Standard web sites.
- **Mobile Web Placements** - Web sites optimized for browsers on mobile
  tablets and phones.
- **Mobile Apps Placements** - Applications installed on mobile tablets
  and phones.

Best Practices for Supply Type Targeting

Targeting is set to **ON** by default for all device and supply types.
When configuring your targeting settings, adhere to these practices for
best results when serving:

- To target in-app inventory, be sure that **Tablets** and **Phones**
  are set to **ON**.
- App targeting (set within Inventory Targeting) applies only to mobile
  app impressions. To target mobile app impressions exclusively, set
  **Apps Placements** to **ON** and **Web Placements** and **Mobile Web
  Placements** to **OFF**.
- Domain targeting (set within Inventory Targeting) applies only to web
  or mobile web impressions. To target domain impressions exclusively,
  set **Web Placements** and **Mobile Web Placements** to **ON** and
  **Apps Placements** to **OFF**.
  - To target PC-based web placements exclusively, set **Web
    Placements** to **ON** and **Mobile Web Placements** and **Apps
    Placements** to **OFF**.
  - To target mobile-based web placements exclusively, set **Mobile Web
    Placements** to **ON** and **Web Placements** and **App Placements**
    to **OFF**.



Note: The choices you make here affect
the targeting options configured further in the procedure. If mobile
options are not listed, contact your Xandr
representative.
