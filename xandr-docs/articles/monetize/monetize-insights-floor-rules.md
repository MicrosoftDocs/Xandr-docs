# Floor Rule







<b>Note:</b> This feature is part of a
functionality that is currently in **Beta**. It is still under
development and may be subject to change without notice. Contact your
Xandr Account Representative to get enabled.





A floor can be thought of as the minimum price a network or publisher
would like to receive for a creative. Floor Rule name is the name
configured for the Yield Management floor that caused the block. Drill
down of this feature shows the impact on specific buyers.


<b>Note:</b> We recommend reviewing floors (at
least quarterly) so that they are set at parity with other SSP platforms
for the same supply.
