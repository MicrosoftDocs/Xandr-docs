# Creative API services

To serve a creative in Xandr's platform, bidders must use the [Creative Service](creative-service.md) to register their creatives. Bidders may then search through their creatives to find those that meet certain criteria using the [Creative Search Service](creative-search-service.md).

See the [Quick Start Creative Buying Guide](quick-start-creative-buying-guide.md) to get started. For more details, see the relevant service references.
