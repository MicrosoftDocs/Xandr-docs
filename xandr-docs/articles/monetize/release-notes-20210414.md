# April 14, 2021: New Ad Quality Technical Attribute



We've added a new Ad Quality technical attribute. Total Load \>4MB is
now available to prevent ads greater than 4MB on Chrome browsers.
Eligibility of this attribute depends on the default eligibility setting
for technical attributes on each member's Ad Quality profile. Most
profiles are set to Eligible, which
means Total Load \>4mb will not be enforced by default, but any default
setting of Banned will enforce the
attribute.
