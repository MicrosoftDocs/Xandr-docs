# Remove the Scheduling From a Saved Lookup



If you have administrative permissions, you can remove the scheduling
from saved availability lookups. This keeps the lookup saved in the
system, but removes its schedules.

This option is available only when a saved lookup has been scheduled.

1.  On the Admin Tools menu,
    click View Saved Lookups. The View
    Saved Lookups page appears, displaying a list of all saved
    availability lookups.
2.  (Optional) Search for the saved lookup using the search toolbar.
3.  Click and select Remove
    Scheduling.
4.  Click Remove to confirm the
    removal.
