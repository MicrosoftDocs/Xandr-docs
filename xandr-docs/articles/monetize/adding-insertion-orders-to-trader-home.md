# Adding Insertion Orders to Trader Home



You can easily track insertion orders directly from Trader Home.

make Trader Home your landing page,
contact your Xandr representative.

To track a particular insertion order in
Trader Home, click
Add to Trader Home. A card displaying
essential information about the insertion order will appear when you
navigate to Trader Home.



<b>Note:</b> To remove an insertion order from
Trader Home, click
Remove from Trader Home. This will
remove the card from Trader Home.
However, the insertion order will remain in the system.
