# Platform-Wide Banning



The Xandr platform rigorously audits and rejects
creatives that do not meet its standards. Before you request banning a
creative from the platform, you should first try blocking it from your
publisher or network using your Ad Quality settings.

Creative Auditing prevents a wide range of creatives from serving based
on the criteria described in
<a href="inventory-standards-and-auditing.md" class="xref">Inventory
Standards and Auditing</a>. Xandr continuously
monitors for issues such as inappropriate or illegal content, malware,
and technology that interferes with the functionality of inventory where
the ad is displayed. For more information about specific standards
required for advertiser creatives, see <a
href="https://microsoftapc.sharepoint.com/teams/XandrServicePolicies/SitePages/Policies-for-Buying.aspx"
class="xref" target="_blank">Policies for Buying</a> (login required).

If you're experiencing unwanted ads on your site, asking for the content
to be banned should be your last resort after you've tried the
strategies suggested in

Ad Quality on Your Inventory</a>. If you're sure the creatives you're
seeing are inappropriate according to Xandr
policies, not just inappropriate for your inventory, you can submit an
issue at https://help.xandr.com.
