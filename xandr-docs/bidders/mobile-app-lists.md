# Mobile app lists

## Mobile app instance bundle ID targeting

Mobile app instance bundle ID targeting is now available in the Bidder UI. Users can create, manage, and target these lists through the Bidder platform. This feature enables advertisers to include or exclude specific mobile app lists.

A bundle ID is a string of characters that advertisers and ad platforms use to identify specific mobile apps, based on the operating system of the device. This is generally the applicationâ€™s unique identifier on their relevant app stores. The mobile app bundle ID targeting alpha allows third-party bidders to target or block app traffic using app store domains and bundle IDs. Users can now sign in to the Bidder UI or use the API to add, edit, or delete blocklists and allowlists using mobile app bundle IDs.

## Create, edit, and delete an app bundle list

To add, manage, or delete an app bundle list in the UI:

1. Navigate to the **[Bidder UI](https://bidder.xandr.com/)**.
1. Select the **Bidder Settings** tab.
1. Scroll down to the **app bundle lists** section.

### Bulk upload or edit bundle lists

Currently, bulk editing functionality is not available in the Bidder UI but can be done through the API.
Below are sample API calls for creating a new list and updating an existing list.

### Create a new bundle list

To create a new bundle list, use the following `POST` request.  

> [!NOTE]
> You must specify the `bidder_id`.

```
POST -- https://api.adnxs.com/app-bundle-list?bidder_id=129 , 
{
    "app-bundle-list": {
        "bidder_id": 129,
        "name": "Mem List 2",
        "description": "Not another bundle list",
        "bundles": [
            "item1",
            "item2"
        ]
    }
}

```

### Edit an existing bundle list

To edit an existing bundle list, use the following PUT request.

```

PUT https://api.adnxs.com/app-bundle-list/22

{
    "app-bundle-list": {
        "id": 22,
        "bidder_id": 129,
        "name": "Test Bidder Bundle List 2",
        "description": "Not another bundle list",
        "bundles": [
            "com.test.com",
            "memcache.8",
            "memcache.9"
        ]
    }
}


```

### FAQ

**Is it possible to target both mobile app and domain lists simultaneously?**

Yes, this is technically possible. However, mobile app bundle lists and domain lists have an AND relationship. If you are already targeting a domain list, create a separate profile to target the app list.
