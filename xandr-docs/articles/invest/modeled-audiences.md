# Microsoft Invest - Modeled audiences

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently in Alpha. It is still under development and may be subjected to changes without notice. To enable this feature, contact your Xandr Account Representative.

Modeled Audience is a feature available for Microsoft Invest that allows advertisers to take their first-party segments and expand them to similar users for targeting. For first-party seed segments, Xandr gathers auction data such as geographic information, device type, and inventory URL. Xandr uses this data and machine learning algorithms to find more users with similar characteristics as those within the first-party segment. These users are then added to the new modeled audience segment.

## Modeled audience requirements

Before you create a modeled audience, make sure:

- The advertiser-owned first-party segments and pixels have over 18,000 daily active users.
- The line item's minimum duration is 30 days.

## Set up a modeled audience

1. In the Microsoft Invest, select the line item for your advertiser.
1. Click **Edit** and select the **Audience & Location Targeting** option on the left pane.
1. An **Audience and Location Segments** panel is displayed on the right. Now, click on **Create Modeled Audience** from the targeting model.
1. Select a **Seed Segment** from the dropdown menu.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Only eligible seed segments are shown in the dropdown menu.

1. Select one of the **Segment Reach** options for the modeled segment:
    - **More Precise**: Includes approximately the top one-third (1/3) of the users in the modeled segment.
    - **Balanced**: Includes approximately the top two-thirds (2/3) of the users in the modeled segment.
    - **More Reach**: Includes all the users in the modeled segment.
1. Click on **Save Modeled Segment** to save your modeled segment. The newly generated segment model will be available within the next 48-72 hours, along with its estimated size.
