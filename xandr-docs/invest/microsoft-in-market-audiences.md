# Microsoft Invest - In-Market audiences

Microsoft In-market Audiences are curated lists of users determined to be in market and ready to buy within a particular category. These segments are based on Microsoftâ€™s unique intent signals, including search on Bing and user activity on Microsoft solutions.
