# Selling in-stream video

To monetize video inventory, you need to successfully describe the
player and its specifications using the placement object. These
capabilities are fully supported by Monetize and
the Xandr API.

Some advantages of trafficking in-stream video placements via the
Xandr platform include:

- Xandr will respond with a bid in under 150ms,
  reducing latency.

- The reach and scale of the Xandr platform
  allows Xandr video buyers to find their
  audience on your inventory. You can take advantage of Programmatic
  Deals, leverage first-party data, and initiate deals with buyers to
  generate increased CPM.

- Xandr offers exclusive access to several large
  demand partners who leverage Xandr as their
  only buying channel. Our integration with all major video DSPs
  provides the greatest available access to demand for
  Xandr platform sellers.

- You can control ad tags, reporting, and yield management settings
  using a single platform for both video and display, greatly
  simplifying important workflows.

- Xandr offers robust targeting and ad quality
  controls for video such as content categories, brand eligibility,
  real-time data integrations for behavioral and contextual targeting,
  and many others.

  This guide explains the placement-level setup for in-stream video, as
  well as how to properly export placement tags.

Setting up in-stream video requires familiarity with
Xandr objects such as publishers, placement
groups and placements. You can find additional useful information about
these topics in the [Selling Guide](selling-guide.md).
