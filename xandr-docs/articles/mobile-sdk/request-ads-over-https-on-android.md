# Request Ads over HTTPS on Android





<b>Note:</b> This property is scheduled to be
deprecated in a future release.



Starting with v2.15 of our SDKs, we support requesting ads over HTTPS.



<b>Note:</b> This is a global setting for the
AppNexus SDK. You only need to set this once,
and all future ad requests will be sent over HTTPS.
