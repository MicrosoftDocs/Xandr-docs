# Inventory Self-Classification



Why Self-Classify?

We strongly encourage all networks to self-audit their inventory for
sensitive attributes and
<a href="content-categories.md" class="xref">Content Categories</a>.
Assigning content categories to your placement groups and placements
allows you to better target your direct inventory. It can also be useful
when <a href="reselling-managed-inventory.md" class="xref">Reselling
Managed Inventory</a>. Assigning sensitive attributes will ensure that
your managed advertisers only serve on inventory that meets their
specifications. Also, buyers have the option to target your inventory
based on whether or not you have self-classified it, so the more
inventory you self-classify the more demand you will see.



<b>Warning:</b> If you sell toolbar, browser
plug-in, or related inventory, you must self-classify the inventory as
such through this tool. See below for more information. Undeclared
toolbar inventory will be suspended within 72 hours as per
Xandr <a

class="xref" target="_blank">Policies for Selling</a> (login required).



Self-Reviewing and Targeting Direct Inventory

If you use inventory quality targeting at the campaign level and you are
targeting your direct inventory, you will only be able to serve on
self-reviewed inventory.

How to Self-Review for Sensitive Attributes

You can review at the placement group or placement level for each
publisher. Placements inherit the placement group's audit settings
unless you override them at the placement level.

Child-Directed Sites

For special rules that apply to identifying child-directed sites, see
our <a
href="https://microsoftapc.sharepoint.com/teams/XandrServicePolicies/SitePages/Policies-for-Selling.aspx"
class="xref" target="_blank">COPPA Policy</a> (login required).

Toolbars, Browser Plug-Ins, and Similar Content

In order to sell toolbar inventory, the toolbar must comply with our <a
href="https://microsoftapc.sharepoint.com/teams/XandrServicePolicies/SitePages/Policies-for-Selling.aspx"
class="xref" target="_blank">prohibited content policy</a> (login
required). Specifically, the toolbar must not obscure or interfere with
the publisher's ads and must have user consent. Additionally, sellers
must:

- Segregate toolbar/browser plugging inventory from other inventory on
  different tags
- Pass the underlying domain (not the toolbar domain) to
  Xandr
- Self-audit toolbar inventory as a toolbar and provide additional
  information so we can assess compliance with our policy

Sellers can comply by entering information into the fields that display
when the **Toolbars, plugins, or extensions** attribute is selected.

How to Self-Review for Content Categories

You can self-review at the placement group level, the placement level,
or both. A placement will inherit all placement group level settings. If
you self-review at the placement group level and the placement level,
the placement will be put in all categories. For example, you might work
with a news site that has a sports section. You may wish to categorize
the placement group for that site as "News" and all placements in the
sports section as "Sports." This categorization will put the placement
into the news category as well as the sports category.
