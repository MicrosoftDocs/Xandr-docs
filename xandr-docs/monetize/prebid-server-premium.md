# Prebid Server Premium

Microsoft Advertising's Prebid Server Premium (PSP) is a self-service, server-side solution designed to maximize publisher revenue through unified auctions. Running on open-source Prebid Server Go, PSP provides transparency into auction mechanics, visibility into winning and losing bids, and access to over 200 demand partners, enabling competition with bidders from the Monetize marketplace. PSPâ€™s integration with the Monetize platform offers publishers flexible, UI-based controls over how inventory is packaged and sent to demand partners. The Monetize Insights dashboard and reporting tools surface optimization opportunities tailored to PSP demand. PSP is supported across multiple channels (web, mobile web, mobile app, over-the-top, accelerated mobile pages) and formats (display, native, video).
