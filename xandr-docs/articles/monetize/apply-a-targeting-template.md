# Apply a Targeting Template





<b>Note:</b> This form of targeting is only
available to Standard Line Items. For an overview of which targeting
options are available to Standard versus Augmented Line items, see
<a href="buy-side-targeting.md" class="xref">Buy-Side Targeting</a>.



Targeting templates allow you to apply pre-established inventory and
user targeting settings to campaigns.

To apply a targeting template during campaign setup, simply select the
relevant template from the **Apply Template** drop-down.



<b>Important:</b> After applying a template,
you can edit your targeting settings as needed or apply a different
template, but you cannot reset your targeting settings to pre-template
state.
