# Explore publisher ad quality

The **Publisher Ad Quality** screen performs several functions:

- Allows you to view network-level ad quality settings such as your Network Profile or Publisher Templates

- Displays your Publisher Base and Conditional Rules. For each rule, the screen displays whether that rule is inheriting from a template
- Informs you of new brands as they are added to the platform

  This document describes the various sections of the **Publisher Ad Quality** screen and their functions.

## Navigation

Choose **Ad Quality** from the **Publishers** menu. Select the publisher from the dialog. Alternatively, from the **Publishers** screen, click on or hover over the publisher you want to work with. Select **Ad Quality** from the **Go to** menu for that publisher.

## Network profile

You can view your Network Profile settings here. To edit them, you'll need to go to the [Network Ad Quality Screen](network-ad-quality-screen.md). For more information, see
[Update Your Network Profile](update-your-network-profile.md).

## Base and conditional rules

You can view and edit your Base and Conditional Rules here. If those rules inherit from a template, they will be marked as such. When a rule inherits from a template, it cannot be edited except by a network administrator. For more information, see [Create Publisher Ad Quality Rules](create-publisher-ad-quality-rules.md).

## Ad quality standards

This section is where you can determine which creatives serve on your inventory based on their creative attributes. You can also set frequency caps based on those attributes.

### Buyers

Edit the trust levels associated with individual buying members.

### Categories

Determine which categories of creative are eligible, e.g. "Airlines" or "Apparel."

### Technical attributes

Determine the eligibility of creatives based on technical attributes such as "Expandables" or "Flash."

### Brands

Allow or exclude creatives based on the brands they are associated with. You can apply a filter to see only new brands.

> [!NOTE]
> If an Ad Quality (AQ) is set as `default_brand_status:banned` but the parent brand is set as `status:trusted`, the child brand overrides the setting in
> `default_brand_status` and it will be able to serve unless it is explicitly banned in the Ad Profile's brand override list.

### Languages

Include or exclude creatives based on the language of the creative.

### Ad servers

Choose to serve only those creatives that are hosted on a specific set of ad server domains (see [Ad Server Settings](ad-server-settings.md) for more information on creating collections of eligible or banned ad servers). (Not available to all customers.)

### Frequency caps

Apply per-user frequency caps to creatives based on their technical attributes. You can also set frequency caps on creatives belonging to a sensitive category, e.g. "Alcoholic Beverages and References."

### Creative approval

Under the **Creative Approval** tab you can search for creatives based on criteria such as who they're managed by or where they served. You can then approve or ban those creatives.

### Common searches

This section provides a convenient interface to some common search parameters, including:

- **Creatives that have served:** Search for creatives that have served on your network's inventory within a specified time period.
- **Creatives that have been uploaded:** Search for creatives of a specific brand status that have been uploaded within a specified time period.

### Advanced options
