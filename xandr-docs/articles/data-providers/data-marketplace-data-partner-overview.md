# Data Marketplace - Data Partner Overview



Buyers on the Xandr platform often use
third-party data made available by our data providers to target
particular audience or inventory in their campaigns.
Xandr now supports the clearing of fees and
charges associated with the purchase of third-party data so that you can
avoid having to invoice individual buyers for these changes.
Instead, Xandr can directly invoice these buyers
for those fees on your behalf.

Note: Only data providers who have
executed the Xandr Data Provider agreement with
Xandr and have provided pricing are eligible to
have the fees cleared by Xandr. 







## Participation

1.  Sign the Xandr Data Provider agreement. To
    obtain a copy of this contract, please contact your account
    representative.
2.  If you are a new data provider, integrate
    with Xandr as an
    <a href="audience-data-integrations.html" class="xref">audience data
    provider</a> or as a real time data provider.
3.  Create the segments that you want to make available to buyers. For
    details, see
    <a href="creating-and-managing-segments.html" class="xref">Creating and
    Managing Segments</a>.
4.  Create a rate card using the <a
    href="attachments/data-marketplace-data-partner-overview/taxonomy-template-new-7-19.xlsx"
    class="xref">taxonomy template</a> consistent with the terms of
    the Xandr Data Provider agreement. Once
    completed, email it to your Xandr point of
    contact.
5.  Once your completed taxonomy template is received by
    the Xandr Data Marketplace team, someone
    from that team will assist you in setting pricing for your segments.
