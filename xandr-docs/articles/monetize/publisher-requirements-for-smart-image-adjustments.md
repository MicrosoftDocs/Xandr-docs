# Publisher Requirements for Smart Image Adjustments



Buyers can use Smart Image Adjustments to automatically resize their
main native creative image and icon, giving publishers the ability to
easily fill their placements with these native creative assets at a much
higher capacity. However, publishers must first ensure that they are
meeting the neccesary placement dimension criteria to ensure that they
will be able to fulfill the buyers' demand.

DSPs such as Oath, TTD, and DBM all require publishers to meet the
minimum placement width and height dimension criteria before a bid can
be submitted. For resizing to work, these DSPs require that the
publisher provide the exact width and height of the placement. For the
ad tag to work, the publisher must meet both the minimum and exact width
and height criteria.

Typically, the publisher also defines the native creative image
requirements using either the exact size of the image or a ratio. The
size of the image is defined by the exact height and width such as 500 x
400. The ratio consists of a `min_width` (in pixels), `ratio_height`,
and `ratio_width`. For more information, see <a

The publisher's required native creative image sizes and dimensions can
be defined in real time using our various supply integration endpoints,
which includes AST, OpenRTB, and our SDK, as well as the Native
Assemebly feature that is available in Monetize. For more information,
