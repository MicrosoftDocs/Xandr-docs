If your campaign is set to buy third-party inventory, your campaign will
target all third-party inventory by default. However, you can narrow
your targeting to include or exclude specific sellers, publishers,
universal content categories, or placements.

1.  In the Targeting section, click
    Edit next to Inventory.
2.  On the 3rd Party Inventory tab,
    include or exclude inventory at the appropriate level:
    - **Sellers** lists shows all third-party sellers from which you can
      buy inventory. You can either include or exclude sellers or drill
      into a seller to view the publishers and content categories
      exposed to you.
    - You can also opt to include or exclude the whole
      Microsoft Monetize supply seller group, or
      click on Microsoft Monetize supply in the
      seller list and drill down to include or exclude specific sellers
      with that designation.
3.  The text button lets you target
    publishers and placements by ID. To do so, click the button to
    switch into text mode, select the type of ID (publisher or
    placement), enter the IDs separated by commas, space, or lines, and
    then select Include or
    Exclude.
4.  Click Add.
