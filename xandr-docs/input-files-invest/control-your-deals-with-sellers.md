# Control Your Deals with Sellers



You can control deals received from sellers on the
Deals screen. You can:

- Set deal review preferences to require a review or allow any new deals
  received from a seller to be set to Active status automatically
- Accept or decline deals upon review
- Manage the status of deals at any time by accepting, deactivating, or
  declining them
- Assign a deal alias (internal name) to any seller deal for easier
  management within your organization



<b>Note:</b> For more information on managing
deals with sellers including viewing basic and advanced deal metrics,
monitoring each deal's health, and running detailed reports, see
<a href="manage-your-deals-with-sellers.md" class="xref">Manage Your
Deals with Sellers</a>.



Getting to the Deals Screen

To reach the Deals with Sellers
screen, select
Partners \> **Deals**
and select the
Sellers tab

Setting Deal Review Preferences

Buyers can configure the default manner in which they process new seller
deals by selecting one of the following settings:

- **Default Active**: new seller deals will be set to **Active** status
  by default when received. Deals can be declined or changed to
  **Inactive** status later if necessary (see
  <a href="control-your-deals-with-sellers.html#ID-000013a8__ID-0000144c"
  class="xref">Managing Deal Status</a>).
- **Require Review**: new seller deals will be set to **Pending** status
  by default when received until the deals are reviewed by the buyer and
  accepted or declined (see
  <a href="control-your-deals-with-sellers.html#ID-000013a8__ID-00001408"
  class="xref">Accepting or Declining Deals</a>).



<b>Note:</b>

- **Default Active** is the default setting if no deal review preference
  is set.
- Changing the review preference only affects new deals. It does not
  change the status of existing deals.

To set the deal review preference for new seller deals, do the
following:



1.  Select
    Partners
    \> Deals
    and select the
    Sellers tab.
2.  On the top right of the Deals
    screen, click the edit icon on New Deals
    Do Not Require Approval (or New
    Deals Require Approval if it’s been changed previously) to
    open Review Preferences.
3.  On the Review Preferences
    page, select either:
    - Default Active – to accept all
      new deals and set their status to **Active**
    - Require Review – to require
      review of all new deals before accepting or declining them
4.  Click Save.

Accepting or Declining Deals

If you have set your buyer review preference to **Require Review** (see
<a href="control-your-deals-with-sellers.html#ID-000013a8__ID-000013d6"
class="xref">Setting Deal Review Preferences</a>), you can then review
new deals and accept or decline them. You can also accept or decline
deals that are in any status (i.e., **Pending**, **Active**,
**Inactive**, or **Declined**). Accepting deals changes the deal status
to **Active** and declining deals changes the deal status to
**Declined**.

Accepted Deals

When you select Accept, the deal is:

- Added to your list of **Active** deals
- Eligible for targeting
- Passed to the bidstream



<b>Note:</b> Accepted deals can be set to
**Inactive** status (see
<a href="control-your-deals-with-sellers.html#ID-000013a8__ID-0000144c"
class="xref">Managing Deal Status</a>) if you want to remove them from
the list of **Active** deals.



Declined Deals

When you select Decline, the deal is:

- Added to your list of **Declined** deals
- Not eligible for targeting
- Not passed to the bidstream



<b>Note:</b> You can change **Declined** deals
to **Active** at any time (see
<a href="control-your-deals-with-sellers.html#ID-000013a8__ID-0000144c"
class="xref">Managing Deal Status</a>).



To accept or decline one or more new deals:

1.  Select
    Partners
    \> Deals
    and select the
    Sellers tab
2.  Check the box next to any deals you want to accept or decline (you
    can search by **Deal Name**, **Deal Alias**, **Deal ID**, or
    Code).
3.  In the **Select** drop-down, select
    Accept or
    Decline.

Managing Deal Status

You can manage the status of deals so you can control when each deal is
available for targeting. A deal can have a status of **Pending**,
**Active**, **Declined**, or Inactive.
The following table provides a description of each status, when the
status occurs, and available actions you can perform given the status of
the deal:

<table class="table">

Change Deal status

To change the status of deals you receive from sellers to **Active**,
**Inactive**, or Declined, do the
following:

- When you set a deal to **Active** status, it will only be active if
  the seller has activated the deal.
- You cannot change the status of a deal to **Pending**. This status is
  only set if a new deal is received when **Review Preferences** is set
  to **Require Review**.

1.  Select
    Partners
    \> Deals
    and select the
    Sellers tab
2.  Click anywhere in the row of the deal you want to change the status
    of (you can search by **Deal Name**, **Deal Alias**, **Deal ID**, or
    Code to find a specific deal).
3.  In the Deal Controls section,
    click the edit icon and select a status from the
    Acceptance Status drop-down.
4.  Click Save.

Setting Groups of Deals to Active or Declined Status

While you can change the status of each deal to **Active** or
**Declined** using the Deal Controls
of each deal, you can only make these changes one deal at a time. If you
have a group of deals that you’d like to set to **Active** or
**Declined** status, you can check the box next to these deals and click
**Accept** in the Select drop-down to
set them to **Active** status, or **Decline** to set them to
**Declined** status (see
<a href="control-your-deals-with-sellers.html#ID-000013a8__ID-00001408"
class="xref">Accepting or Declining Deals</a>).

Assigning a Deal Alias

You can assign a **Deal Alias** to use as a buyer internal name for
seller deals so you can manage these deals by a name you provide for it.
The alias you assign to a deal appears in the
Deal Alias column of the
Deals with Sellers page along with
the **Deal Name** that the seller provided for the deal.



<b>Note:</b> The Deal Alias you assign to a
deal is not viewable by the seller of the deal.



To assign a **Deal Alias** to a deal, do the following:



<b>Note:</b> The
Deal Alias field is limited to 254
characters.



1.  Select Partners \> **Deals**
    and select the
    Sellers tab
2.  Click anywhere in the row of the deal you want to assign a **Deal
    Alias** to (you can search by **Deal Name**, **Deal Alias**, **Deal
    ID**, or Code to find a specific
    deal).
3.  In the Deal Controls section,
    click the edit icon and enter the internal name in the
    Deal Alias field.
4.  Click Save.
