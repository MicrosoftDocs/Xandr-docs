| `GET` | https://api.appnexus.com/thirdparty-pixel?id=THIRDPARTY-PIXEL_ID | View a specific third-party pixel. |
| `POST` | https://api.appnexus.com/thirdparty-pixel | Add a new third-party pixel. |
| `PUT` | https://api.appnexus.com/thirdparty-pixel?id=THIRDPARTY-PIXEL_ID | Modify an existing third-party pixel. |

## JSON fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `active` | boolean | Flag indicating whether the pixel is active.<br><br>**Default**: `true` |
| `adservers` | array of objects | The adservers that the pixel calls. Required for pixels that serve on Google Ad Manager inventory. A full list of adservers can be retrieved from the [ad server service](./ad-server-service.md).<br><br>Example:<br>`"adservers":[{"id":11},{"id":12}]` |
| `advertisers` | array of objects | If the pixel has an owning advertiser (i.e., `advertiser_id` is not `null`), this array must contain the ID (and only the ID) of the advertiser that owns the pixel. As a result, this pixel will render on all creatives owned by that advertiser. If the pixel does not have an owning advertiser, this array can contain multiple advertisers to which the pixel will be applied.<br><br>Example:<br>`"advertisers":[{"id":3}]`<br><br>**Optional** |

Possible values are: <br> - `"pending"` <br> - `"rejected"` <br> - `"approved"` <br> - `"exempt"` <br><br>**Note**:<br> An unaudited pixel will not prevent a creative from serving, but it will not serve along with the creative until it has passed audit.<br><br>**Read Only**<br>**Default**: `"pending"` |
| `content` | string | If the pixel's `format` is `"raw-js"`, this is the JavaScript content to serve with the creative. The `content` and/or `secure_content` fields are required on `POST` for `raw-js` pixels.<br>You can also add macros to your pixel. For a list of the creative macros that you may append to your pixel, see [Creative Macros](../monetize/creative-macros.md) in the UI documentation (customer login required).<br><br>**Required On**: `POST` if the pixel's `format` is `"raw-js"`. |
| `creatives` | array of objects | The creatives to which a pixel is applied. The creatives must belong to the owning member/advertiser.

| format | string | The format of the pixel. Possible values for creatives: <br> - `"raw-js"`<br> - `"url-html"`<br> - `"url-js"`<br> - `"url-image"`<br> - `"raw-url"`<br><br>**Required On**: `POST` and `PUT` if changing `content`, `secure_content`, `url`, or `url_secure` fields.<br><br>**Default**: `"raw-js"` |
| `id` | int | The ID of the third-party pixel.<br><br>**Required On**: `PUT` and `DELETE`. |

## Examples

### View a specific third-party pixel

In this example, we view a third-party pixel with ID `123`.

```
$ curl -b cookies -X GET 'https://api.appnexus.com/thirdparty-pixel?id=123'
 
{
    "thirdparty-pixel":{
        "id":123,
        "active":true,
        "member_id":456,
        "advertiser_id": 789,
        "format":"raw-js",
        "content":"var img = new Image(); img.src="https://url.com/event/js?self=" + data;"
        "url":null,
        "secure_url":null,
        "members":null,
        "advertisers":[{"id":789}], 
        "creatives":null
        "audit_status":"unaudited" // admin only
        "supply_exceptions":[
            {"name":"AdX"},
        ]
        "adservers":[
            {"id":123}
        ]
  }
}
```

### Add a new third-party pixel

In this example, we create a new sell-side third-party pixel with ID `123`. Note that parent object information is `"null"` because the JSON file we passed into the API did not specify a parent object for the pixel.

```
$ cat thirdparty-pixel.json
{
  "thirdparty-pixel":
    {
      "format":"url-html",
      "secure_url":"https://secureurl.com"
    }
}  

$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @thirdparty_pixel 'https://api.appnexus.com/thirdparty-pixel'

{
    "response":{
        "status":"OK",
        "count":1,
        "id":123,
        "start_element":0,
        "num_elements":100,
        "thirdparty-pixel":{
            "id":123,
            "active":true,
            "name":null,
            "member_id":456,
            "advertiser_id":789,
            "publisher_id":null,
            "format":"url-html",
            "audit_status":"pending",
            "created_on":"2014-11-05 19:51:44",
            "last_modified":"2014-11-05 19:51:44",
            "url":null,
            "secure_url":"https://secureurl.com",
            "members":null,
            "advertisers":null,
            "publishers":null,
            "creatives":null,
            "supply_exceptions":null,
            "adservers":null
       
    }
}
```

### Update a third-party pixel

In this example, we update a third-party pixel with the ID `123`, applying it to all of the owning advertiser's creatives.

```
$ cat pixelupdate.json

{
  "thirdparty-pixel":
    {
      "advertisers":[{"id":789}]
    }
}  

$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X PUT -d @pixelupdate 'https://api.appnexus.com/thirdparty-pixel?id=123'

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "id":123
   }
}
```

### Delete a third-party pixel

In this example, we delete a third-party pixel with the ID `123`.

```
$ curl -b cookies -X DELETE 'https://api.appnexus.com/thirdparty-pixel?id=123'

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK"
   }
}
```
