# Microsoft Monetize - Create a custom role

If you need more fine-grained control over how your users access Microsoft Monetize, you can create a custom role. Custom roles allow you to control what a user sees in Microsoft Monetize so they only see the parts of your business that you choose.

Custom roles control the actions a user is allowed to take, such as the ability to view information or full permissions to modify that same information. For example, you may want an external sales house to have limited booking and reporting access. This page shows you how to create a custom role. For more information about roles, see [Working with Roles](working-with-roles.md).

- Select **Roles** from the top right corner under the member (Click on member name to get the dialog).
  
## Create role

- From the **Roles** management screen, in the **Custom Roles** section, click **+New**.
- The **Create Role** screen will appear, where you can choose which permissions this custom role will have along with other details as mentioned below.
