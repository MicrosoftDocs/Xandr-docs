# Reselling managed inventory

In addition to selling your publishers' inventory to managed advertisers, you can also resell to the entire Microsoft Advertising platform. This section of the
documentation will provide an overview of reselling-related settings, as well as offer instructions for how to configure your inventory for reselling.

Inventory can be made targetable at the network and publisher levels. It can only be made buyable at the placement group level.

Therefore, in order to allow buyers to target and purchase your inventory, you must take the following actions:

- **Expose inventory for targeting by buyers:** This is also known as "reselling exposure", and can be done for the entire network or per-publisher. This makes it targetable. For instructions, see [Managing Your Inventory Reselling Exposure](managing-your-inventory-reselling-exposure.md) and "Step 7. Choose the exposure settings" in [Create a Publisher](create-a-publisher.md).
- **Enable placement groups (and all of their placements) for resale:** In order to be resold to other members, a placement group must be enabled for resale by setting it to participate in the RTB Marketplace. This makes it buyable. For instructions on how to toggle this setting, see [Create a Placement Group](create-a-placement-group.md).
