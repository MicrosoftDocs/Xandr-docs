# Microsoft Invest - Video completion rate targeting

You can opt to buy only video impressions that are predicted to result in the video being viewed to completion by selecting the
**Video Completion Rate Threshold** checkbox in the **Viewability & Environment Targeting** section and entering a percentage value.

Xandr collects historical information about video completion in order to predict the probability that a particular video creative will be played to completion.
