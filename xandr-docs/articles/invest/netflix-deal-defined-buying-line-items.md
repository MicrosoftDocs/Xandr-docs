# Netflix Deal Defined Buying Line Items



<b>Note:</b> This feature is currently in
Alpha. It is still under development and is subject to change without
notice. To enable this feature, contact your Xandr Account
Representative.

## Overview

Due to the premium nature of Netflix inventory, Netflix PMP deals are
considered "Seller Defined Deals," meaning the seller defines the
targeting parameters the buyer is allowed to configure. The Deal Defined
Line Item workflow in the Invest DSP only displays the settings the
buyer is able to control, eliminating the potential for conflict between
a buyer and seller, and thus maximizing win rates.


## Before You Begin

Before you create a **Deal Defined** line item, you must perform the
following tasks:

- <a
  href="create-an-advertiser.md"
  class="xref" target="_blank">Create an Advertiser</a>
- <a
  href="create-an-insertion-order.md"
  class="xref" target="_blank">Create an Insertion Order</a>

The insertion order you created must have at least one billing period
with dates in the future.

You must also have access to one or more PMP deals to target. Sellers
must first create these deals for buyers to access them for targeting.
If you have questions about how to gain access to a PMP deal, contact
your account manager.




## Access Netflix PMP Deals

To access a Netflix PMP deal, do the following:

1.  Click Your Deals in the
    Inventory menu
2.  In the Your Deals screen, ensure
    that the Deal Type is set to
    PMP.
3.  Choose the appropriate deal from the
    Your Deals screen.
4.  Select the corresponding
    Advertiser and
    Insertion Order associated
    with that particular PMP Deal.
5.  Click Go To Line Item Create to
    launch the page to create the Deal
    Defined Line Item.

    screen, select
    Augmented
    Line Item \> Deal
    Defined under Line Item
    Type
    

    <b>Important:</b> You must have an
    Advertiser and
    Insertion Order associated
    with the Line item in the Advertiser and Insertion Order sections.

3.  Click Next to open the
    Create a Deal Defined Line
    Item screen.



## Buying Netflix via PMP on Invest DSP

The primary difference between a **Deal Defined Line Item** and a
standard **Augmented Line Item** is the deal relationship. Only one deal
is allowed on a Deal Defined line item, and the settings of that deal
will determine which targeting settings are displayed for you to
configure. Because there is only one deal targeted, the buyer must
ensure to take the suggested minimum bid of the deal (ask price + BASC)
into account when formulating their bidding strategy. When using maximum
revenue bids, the max will need to be higher than this suggestion in
order to successfully win.

## Creative Rotation and Associated Creatives

**Creative Requirements for Netflix PMP Deals**



To serve on Netflix inventory, CTV creatives must meet strict guidelines
and technical specifications that have been set by Netflix to ensure an
optimal user experience. We recommend that Invest DSP buyers consider
dedicated creatives when buying Netflix, and consider the context that
the advertisement is in and how it will appear on Netflix content. For
more information on CTV creatives specification, see <a
href="creative-ctv-guidelines-and-specifications.md"
class="xref" target="_blank">Creative CTV Guidelines and
Specifications</a>.



<b>Important:</b> The Line item must be
associated to a Netflix PMP deal for **Creative Requirements for the
Selected Deal** to display. You must have at least one associated
creative for each media type and ad size listed for the deal.





**Creative Rotation**

Select the Creative Rotation Strategy:

- **Auto-optimize creative weight**: The creative with the highest
  click-through-rate (CTR) delivers the most

- **Evenly weight creatives**: The even rotation is handled
  automatically by our system

- **Manually weight creatives**: The rotation is based on a user-
  supplied weight

**Associated Creatives**

1.  Search for the creative name or the ID, to open the
    Associated Creatives dialog.
2.  Select the creatives you want to associate to your PG line item from
    the Available Creatives list
    by clicking on the check next to the name. Selected creatives will
    appear in the Selected
    Creatives list. Ensure that you have at least one associated
    creative for each media type and ad size listed in
    Creative Requirements for the PG
    Deal. For more information on how to add creatives, see
    <a href="add-a-creative.md" class="xref"
    title="You can add a creative by either uploading a spreadsheet or the creative files directly from your computer. Only secure content is supported.">Add

If not, you can click More Details, to see which requirements need to be adjusted in order to serve on Xandrâ€™s premium publisherâ€™s CTV inventory. The CTV specification validations and approval indicators will be present throughout the Line item and Creative workflows in various tooltips and issues columns, as well.">Creative
