## Accessing Smart Image Adjustments for Native Creatives

By default, the Allow Smart Image
Adjustments toggle is enabled for all buyers that have access to
Invest or Monetize. To keep to our recommended native best practices,
see <a

## How Smart Image Adjustments Works

If buyers bid with a native creative image that doesn't exactly match
the dimensions of a publisher's placement, Xandr
will automatically resize the image by adding white bars to fill the
placement when the Allow Smart Image
Adjustments toggle is enabled. If the buyer doesn't want white
bars added, they should select the Crop image
to fit placement radio button after clicking the
Allow Smart Image Adjustments toggle
so that the image is cropped and centered without white bars. For more
information, see <a href="add-a-creative.md" class="xref"

When using Smart Image Adjustments within Invest and Monetize, the main
native creative image and icon can only be resized up to 200% and down
to 50% of the original aspect ratio. Smart Image Adjustments can also
convert native creative images vertically and horizontally. This can be
done with our Creative Service API , which gives you more control over
the max scale factor and aspect ratio bounds. For more information, see
<a
href="xandr-api/creative-service.md"
class="xref" target="_blank">Creative Service API</a>. The original
dimensions of the native creative ultimately determine what is possible.
