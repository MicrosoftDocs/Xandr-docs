# Bulk importer guidelines for creatives

Please adhere to these general guidelines:

- Please do not rename the Creatives sheet within the bulk importer template.
- When adding custom date range details to the **Start Date** and **End Date** columns, leave the cells that are on the same row as the other creative details empty.
- If adding multiple start dates and end dates, be sure to place each individual date on separate rows.
- If a creative does not apply to all flights and does not have a custom date range, the creative identifier must also be entered on the Line Items sheet in the corresponding **Flight Creatives** column.

## Temporary ID information

| Column Name | Description | Potential Values | Mandatory | Examples |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| LI Temporary Id | Specifies the identifier used to link a creative to a parent line item within the spreadsheet. This is a placeholder value and will not be the actual identifier of the newly-created object. | Alphanumeric value | No | example123 |

## Creative setup
