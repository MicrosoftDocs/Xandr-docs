# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)



Q: Why are my third-party numbers different than first-party numbers?

A: There are several possible reasons for such a discrepancy:  

- Technological discrepancy - This occurs when the internet pipe
  "breaks" before the resulting ad is delivered (e.g., The connection is
  too slow and times out, or the user hits the back button or a new link
  before the ad has a chance to load). This causes a positive
  discrepancy.
- Accounting discrepancy - Because a huge percentage of internet traffic
  is not human, every vendor uses techniques to weed out and discount
  bot traffic. These techniques are not all the same. Therefore,
  what one vendor discounts as bot traffic, another counts as
  discrepancy. This discrepancy can be either positive or negative.
- Trafficking error - Complex ads can cause trafficking errors. An
  example of this is a tag with an embedded VAST tag in a flash ad,
  along with a non-flash static banner. This complexity can lead to
  cases where a single counted local event unintentionally sends
  multiple third-party event signals. This causes a negative
  discrepancy.
- Agency distributes the wrong tag - Sometimes, an agency sends two
  publishers the same exact tracker by accident. Both publishers are
  sending local impressions to that tag causing the third-party number
  to rise. When the publisher pulls the report from the third-party
  reporting system, ALL impressions from ALL sources are present in that
  report. So, the publisher may have only delivered 100k impressions to
  that DFA tag, but the report claims 2MM.
- Outside of view impressions - Sometimes, a publisher traffics a tag
  into a system to which Ad-Juster is not connected to (e.g., a
  newsletter email system). In these cases, third-party numbers are
  inflated.
