# Segment usage by buyers

The way a given client utilizes shared segments, contextual, behavioral or otherwise, is highly dependent upon they way the client is integrated with Xandr. Clients who have implemented their own bidder will see the full details for every impression. For more details, see Xandr's [Bidders page](xandr-s-bidders.md). Clients using to traffic campaigns will see the segments available for targeting but do not have visibility into the details for each auction. For more details, see Xandr's [UI Clients page](xandr-s-ui-clients.md).
