Microsoft Advertising Outstream Video offers the capability to insert a smart player into your page content that will expand when the container is in view and, depending on its configuration, only play video and or sound based on publisher-defined criteria. The player is highly flexible: it works in Flash and HTML5, supports VPAID Flash and
VPAID JavaScript, and works on desktop and mobile web. Video demand is delivered as VAST XML via RTB. Pages are tagged using [Microsoft Advertising's seller tag](../seller-tag/seller-tag.md) (AST) which supports multiple placements per page and multiple media types per placement.
