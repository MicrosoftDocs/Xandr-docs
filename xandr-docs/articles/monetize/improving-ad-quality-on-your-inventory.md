# Improving Ad Quality on Your Inventory



In addition to a robust creative auditing program that ensures a high
standard of advertising, Xandr also provides extensive rule-based tools
for managing network and publisher ad quality concerns, including
competitive ads and incompatible subject matter.

Ad quality is a subjective term that needs to be considered in terms of
your inventory's requirements. If you find ads on your or your
publisher's site that you consider inappropriate or low in value, there
are several ways to ensure that a creative, or a certain type of
creative, doesn't show up there again. Microsoft Monetize offers the
following options for controlling what content can serve on your
inventory. These rule-based Ad Quality controls are provided in addition
to the <a
href="https://docs.xandr.com/bundle/monetize_monetize-standard/page/topics/creative-standards.html"
class="xref" target="_blank">Creative Standards</a> that Xandr applies
to all creatives served on the controls are provided in addition to the
<a
href="https://docs.xandr.com/bundle/monetize_monetize-standard/page/topics/creative-standards.html"
class="xref" target="_blank">Creative Standards</a> that Xandr applies
to all creatives served on the platform.



You can use the following controls to determine what ads are allowed to
serve on your inventory:
