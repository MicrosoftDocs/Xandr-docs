# Add, edit, or delete a PSP configuration

Once inventory has been [Integrated with Prebid Server Premium (PSP)](integrate-with-psp.md), [Global Settings have been reviewed](add-or-edit-psp-global-settings.md), and [Demand Partners have been enabled](add-or-edit-a-demand-partner.md), inventory must be mapped to Demand Partners via PSP configurations. These mappings allow the Demand Partners to identify the inventory being sent in the request from PSP.

PSP configurations can be applied at the Placement, Placement Group (site), or Publisher (all child Placements and Placement Groups) level.

Configurations can be created and modified:

- directly within the UI,

- through the [Config Service API](../digital-platform-api/config-service.md),

- and in bulk, through an Excel template.

For more details, please refer to:

- [Create a New PSP Configuration](create-a-psp-configuration.md)
- [Manage a PSP Configuration](manage-a-psp-configuration.md)
- [Manage PSP Configurations in Bulk](manage-psp-configurations-in-bulk.md)
