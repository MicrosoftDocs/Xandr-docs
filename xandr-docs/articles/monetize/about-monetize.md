# About Monetize



Microsoft Monetize is a web-based application for
your programmatic advertising. Whether you’re buying or selling ad
space, or both, Monetize provides all the tools
that you need to manage your accounts.



## Buyers

Monetize can manage both traditional media buys
and real-time bidding through a single, unified interface. Instead of
operating an ad server and a buying platform,
Monetize can perform both functions, eliminating
double-trafficking, discrepancies, and another set of fees.

Monetize offers:

- Seamless integration with major ad networks, exchanges, aggregators,
  and SSPs.
- Site list with volume and price estimates.
- Direct and managed media buys and auction-based buys through one
  simple interface.
- Built-in fraud protections and inventory quality protections.
- No need for contracts with each publisher or exchange.

A number of other key features help Xandr
optimize your ad buying revenue and increase buying efficiency.





## Sellers

Monetize has a number of features that allow you
to maintain business and technical relationships with your managed
publishers. With Monetize, you can:

- Set up publishers and traffic campaigns on managed inventory.
- Resell inventory on the Xandr platform for
  better monetization.
- Apply optimization strategies to your direct campaigns since
  optimizing direct campaigns is as important as optimizing on
  third-party inventory.
- Manage individual publishers' ad quality requirements, ensuring that
  you meet expectations about the quality and content of ads served on
  their sites.





## Adserver

As an Adserver user, you have access to your end-to-end setup of
advertiser and publisher information. You can set up publishers and
available inventory, as well as advertisers and their selling
specifications. With Adserver, you can set up and manage your buy-side
systems and your sell-side systems, as well as manage forecasting,
priorities, and many other types of functionality between the two.





## Technical Details

The Xandr platform is a real-time bidding system
and ad server. The main processing system here is called the "impression
bus". The impression bus receives ad requests, applies data to the
request, receives bids, makes decisions, serves creatives, logs
auctions, etc.

Ad calls come in via our inventory supply partners: exchanges, SSPs, ad
networks, and a few valued publishers. Some of the ad calls are
client-side, meaning there is a Xandr tag on the
page, and we get the call directly. Others are server-side, meaning our
partners initially field the call and then contact us asking for a bid.

Once we get the call, we overlay segment data from our server-side
cookie store. Data is added to the cookie store either through segment
pixels or by clients sending us a file of data. We also contact
third-party data providers and overlay any available data.

We contact all of the bidders on our platform. The ad call includes
whatever user data belongs to each bidder, and information about the
inventory. Bidders have a certain number of milliseconds in which to
respond with a bid and the creative they want to serve.

Monetize serves as our proprietary bidder, which
has a suite of features including campaigns and targeting, bidding
algorithms, multi-currency support, and all the other features of a
premium ad server. It can be accessed by either a UI or an API.

The impression bus decides which bid wins based on the amount of the bid
and any preferences the publisher has about what they want served on
their page. If the call was client-side, Xandr
serves the ad. If it was server-side, Xandr
passes the bid and the location of the creative to the partner who will
ultimately serve the ad.
