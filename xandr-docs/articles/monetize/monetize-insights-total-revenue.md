## **Navigation Bar, Global Filters and Date Selection**

The Navigation bar located at the top of the
Insights page allows you to
seamlessly switch between Total
Revenue, offering a comprehensive view of KPIs and trends across
all channels, and individual channels. At the global level, you can
apply filters that will be effective across all tabs in
Insights, in addition to choosing
specific date ranges, with the flexibility to select a date range
spanning up to 31 days ago, and an option to compare it to the
immediately preceding time period, as far back as 62 days ago. The data
is presented with a daily granularity in the UTC time zone, and the most
recent data available corresponds to the prior day once the processing
for that day is completed.

particular brand selected, can reveal details such as revenue
impressions, CPM, the percentage of total revenue, and the number of

comparative chart is displayed, followed by a detailed chart and table,

## **Fidelity of Data**

Data within Insights is presented
at a daily granularity in the (UTC) timezone and is updated daily to
reflect data from the previous day (UTC). Adjustments for fixed-fee
managed line items made on the same day are considered, but adjustments
occurring at the end of a multi-day flight are not retrospectively
applied. Metric totals are processed to align with reporting figures,
with the exception of the brand dimension, which serves as an indicative
measure for identifying anomalies.

For the brand dimension, data is processed to reduce data fidelity on
long-tail transactions where the daily revenue from a brand on a
specific placement is less than $5. In this scenario the revenue,
impressions and CPM will be attributed to a category labeled
"Below Threshold." For precise
metrics by brand, it is recommended to utilize reporting tools rather
than relying solely on Insights.
