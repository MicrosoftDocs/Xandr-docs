# Political Geography Targeting





Political geography targeting allows political buyers to target
geographies based on legislative district boundaries. Political buyers
who support candidates often want to run campaigns based on political
geographies, and leveraging political district targeting is a powerful
way for buyers to achieve highly granular and precise geographical
targeting. The Political Geography Targeting thus plays a key factor in
driving performance, as it enables buyers to target the important
geographic constructs which is imperative to the buyer's and to their
client's successes respectively.



<b>Note:</b> The feature is available within
the existing geo targeting module in Invest DSP,
and it's called "Political District (US Only)".
