- **Settings**: Provides basic information about the insertions order such as budgeting, billing, supply strategy, and reporting labels.
- **Edit**: Edits an insertion order.
- **Legacy view**: Switches to insertion order's legacy view.
- **Line Items**: Provides a list of the line items currently associated with the insertion order.
