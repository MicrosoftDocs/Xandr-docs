# Charges for Sellers





## Seller Auction Service Charge (SASC)

Also known as Seller Revenue Share in some contracts, SASC is the charge
for selling inventory to third-party buyers. It is quoted as a
percentage of the buyer's media cost, and deducted prior to the
calculation of seller revenue.



## Managed Ad Serving Fee

The charge for serving managed, kept, mediated, or direct impressions
and for serving default creatives, PSAs, and blanks.



## Seller Revenue Share Minimum Fee

For contracts which contain a clause that requires a Seller Revenue
Share Minimum fee (included on your Buyer invoice for Seller activity
during the invoiced period), we review Xandr's
earnings from the Seller’s resold traffic and apply a minimum CPM (the
exact value applied is defined in the contract). For example, assuming
the Seller Auction Service fee = **10%** and the Seller Revenue Share
Minimum fee CPM = **$0.01 CPM**, the following calculations could be
made:

In this example, the Seller would receive an additional line item on
their invoice labelled “Seller Rev Share Minimum” for $10,000 ($30,000 -
$20,000).

The Seller Revenue Share Minimum fee will appear on invoices as the
DIFFERENCE between the Seller Revenue Share Minimum fee and the Seller
Auction Service Fee.





<b>Warning:</b> Gross Resold Revenue does not
appear in the UI. Resold Revenue is net earnings to the network after
Xandr Seller and Buyer Auction Service Charges
have been applied.
