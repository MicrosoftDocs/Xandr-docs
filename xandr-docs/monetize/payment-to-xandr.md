# Microsoft Monetize - Payments

## Microsoft Advertising invoice information

Microsoft Advertising invoices are sent within 5 business days of the end of the previous month of service; for example, for March purchase of media the invoice date would be no later than April 7 (at the latest).

Payment terms are typically net 30 from the date of invoice. Refer to your contract for further information on your payment terms.

For general information on your invoice, see [Understanding your Invoice](understanding-your-invoice.md).

If you have signed a new Microsoft Advertising contract, the invoices will maintain the same cadence. For more information on payment terms, please refer to the [Understanding your invoice](understanding-your-invoice.md) section.
