There are two types of content categories:

- **Universal:** Universal categories are defined by
  Xandr. When Xandr
  reviews inventory, we apply these categories based on the inventory's
  content. For example, a car dealership placement group would be
  assigned to the "Autos & Vehicles" category. Sellers can apply
  universal categories when self-reviewing inventory as well.
- **Custom:** Custom categories are defined by sellers. Sellers create
  these and apply them to slices of their inventory to package their
  inventory for specific buyers to target.

This page explains how to target each type of content category.

Target Universal Categories

By default, your campaign will target all universal categories. However,
you can narrow your targeting to include or exclude specific universal
categories.

1.  In the Targeting section, click
    Edit next to **Inventory**.
2.  On the Universal Categories tab,
    include or exclude custom categories.
    - The **Categories** lists shows all top-level universal categories
      defined by Xandr. You can either include
      or exclude top-level categories or drill into a category to view
      its child categories.
    - The **Sub-Categories** list shows all child universal categories
      in the context of their parent categories. You can either include
      or exclude sub-categories. Note that when you exclude a top-level
      category, its sub-categories are not available for further
      inclusion or exclusion.

    

    Important: When targeting more than
    one universal category, the categories have an OR relationship. For
    example, if you target the "News" and "Finance" categories, you will
    bid on inventory that is in either category. The inventory does not
    need to be in both categories.

Target Custom Categories

By default, your campaign will target all custom categories. However,
you can narrow targeting to include or exclude specific custom
categories that you have applied to your own placement groups and/or
placements for direct buying as well as custom categories that other
sellers have exposed to you for third-party buying.

1.  In the Targeting section, click
    Edit next to **Inventory**.

2.  On the Custom Categories tab,
    include or exclude custom categories.

    When targeting more than one custom category, the categories have an
    OR relationship. For example, if you include "Custom Category 1" and
    "Custom Category 2", you will bid on inventory that is in either
    category. The inventory does not need to be in both categories.

3.  Click Add.
