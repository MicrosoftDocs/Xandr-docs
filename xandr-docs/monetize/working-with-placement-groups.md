# Working with placement groups

The placement group object is the middle level of the sell-side hierarchy (**Publishers** \> **Placement Groups** \> **Placements**). Placement groups provide a way for you to organize placements for management purposes and apply inventory categorization and self-auditing criteria to child placements by default.
