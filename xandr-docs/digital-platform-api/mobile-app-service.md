# Mobile App service

This read-only service is used to retrieve **mobile apps that have been audited by Xandr**, as well as their associated instances. For the purposes of this service, a *mobile app* is defined as the canonical representation of an application, while a version of that app designed to run on a particular device (a "port") would be an *instance* of that app. This is analogous to the distinction between a class and an instance of a class.

For example, ifÂ `"Happy Pirate Party Pro"` is a mobile app, in order to represent the app, its instances would include the Android version, the iOS version, the Windows Phone version, and any other versions that run as apps on mobile devices.

{
    "response": {
        "status": "OK",
        "count": 163,
        "start_element": 0,
        "num_elements": 100,
        "mobile-apps": [

In this example, we retrieve information about a single mobile app, including information about its registered instances. You can use the instance ID to get information using the [Mobile App Instance Service](./mobile-app-instance-service.md).

```
$ curl -b cookies https://api.appnexus.com/mobile-app?id=4
 
{
    "response": {
        "status": "OK",
        "count": 1,
        "start_element": 0,
        "num_elements": 100,

            "mobile-app-instance": [
                {
                    "id": 4,
                    "last_modified": "2014-02-13 17:07:32",
                    "created_on": "2014-02-13 17:07:32",
