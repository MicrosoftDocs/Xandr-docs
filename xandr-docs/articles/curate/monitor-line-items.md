# Monitor Line Items



The Line Items screen displays
Upcoming,
In Progress, and
Completed line items and metrics. It
also lets you search for line items and related objects, apply filters,
modify display columns, and download reports.



## Access Monitoring

To access the Monitoring feature from
any Microsoft Monetize screen:

1.  Click the Package menu and select
    Curated Deals
2.  In the Line Items window,
    select an appropriate progress tab
    (Upcoming,
    In Progress, or
    Completed) to view line items.



>

## View Line Items

The Line Items window displays
line items in rows under three progress tabs:
Upcoming,
In Progress, or
Completed. Line items appear under
each progress tab as follows:

- Upcoming - line items that have not
  started.
- In Progress - line items between
  flights (start date/time of the first flight and end date/time of the
  last flight).
- Completed â€“ line items that have
  completed and are past their end date/time of the last flight.

## Understand Line Item Columns

The Upcoming,
In Progress, and
Completed progress tabs each list line
items in rows. The rows include columns with the line item name and
relevant metrics for the line items.

Hover over the tooltips next to each metric at the top of each column
for a brief description of the metric. The metrics provide important
information about upcoming, in progress, and completed line items
without requiring you to run a report. The metrics are updated
regularly.



<b>Note:</b> There might be discrepancies
between the metrics displayed in the Line
Items monitoring view and reporting data due to slight variations
in data syncing. For more information, see
<a href="availability-of-reporting-data.md" class="xref">Availability
of Reporting Data</a>.

## Search for Line Items

There are several ways to search for line items from the
Line Items window. You can search
for line items by line item name, line item ID, deal name, or deal ID.
Inactive line items are listed in gray italic text.

## Use Pagination

If you don't have a line item name, line item ID, deal name, or deal ID
to search with, you can use the pagination feature at the bottom of the
Line Items window to page through
the rows of line items. The pagination feature lets you:

- Select the number of rows that you want to display per page by
  selecting a value from the Rows per
  page menu.
- Enter a specific page in the designated text field or click the arrows
  to navigate from page to page.
