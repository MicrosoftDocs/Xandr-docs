# Set Targeting Access Privileges



You can set targeting access privileges for a specific buyer within the
Partner Controls tab. The more
information you expose to buyers, the more easily they can target your
inventory. If you do not set targeting access for the buyer, your
default targeting access settings will apply.

You can also <a

class="xref">manage a buyer's targeting access settings</a> in the
Partner Center screen. However, you
can only view the buyer's current settings here on the
Partner Privileges tab.

Getting There

Select
Partners
\>  Partner Center from the top
navigation menu.

Step 1. Get started

Once in the Partner Center, click
on the Partner Controls tab.

Step 2. Switch to edit mode

Click Edit to make the targeting
access settings editable.

Step 3. Update settings

Select the desired radio button for each targeting access option,
Hide (hide information from the buyer)
or Expose (show information to the
buyer).

For more information on the different targeting access options, see the
Setting default targeting access
section within
<a href="partner-center-screen-seller-view.html" class="xref">Setting
Buyer Defaults</a>.



Note: Age and gender targeting
information can only be shared if you include the
Xandr age and gender macro when exporting your
placement tag. For more information, see
<a href="placement-tag-parameters.html" class="xref">Placement Tag
Parameters</a>.





Important: You will have the option to
expose domains or full URLs to external buyers.



For **Categories (Custom)**, there is the additional option to expose
specific categories. To select specific custom categories, click the
Edit button near the **Expose Custom**
option to open the Categories
dialog. Click on a category in the
Available Items area to add it to
the Selected Items area. To remove
a category from the Selected Items
area, click on the X next to the
category name. When you have finished selecting custom categories, click
Add to save your changes.

Step 4. Save your changes

When all changes have been made, click the
Apply button.
