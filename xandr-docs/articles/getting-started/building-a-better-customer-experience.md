# Building a Better Customer Experience 

At Xandr, we continually strive to improve your experience with our products, and that includes our product documentation.

## Public vs. Proprietary Documentation 

Xandr offers two types of access to our product documentation:

-   Public: Anyone can view this documentation, and can find it through any of the standard internet search engines.
-   Proprietary: Some content contains information that is restricted to Xandr employees or to customers who've signed non-disclosure agreements. A login is required to view this documentation.

All of our *public* documentation is accessible from right here in our Documentation Center \(docs.xandr.com\). Most of our *proprietary* documentation is currently available at wiki.xandr.com, where clients and Xandr employees can use their existing login credentials to access this documentation. There is also a small amount of proprietary documentation for our Invest DSP, Monetize SSP, and Curate products that is available only from within the product; you must be logged in to the product to see the information. \(Most of the documentation for those products is available here publicly and also from within the product.\)

**To summarize**:

-   Public: Documentation Center \(docs.xandr.com\). Easy access, no login required, searchable from your favorite internet search engine. \(Also still available on wiki.xandr.com, but only if you log in, and product-specific public documentation is available from within Invest DSP, Monetize SSP, and Curate.\)
-   Proprietary: Available at wiki.xandr.com with your existing login credentials, and from Invest DSP, Monetize SSP, or Curate with your client login credentials.

## Benefits of the Documentation Center 

-   **Clear and easy navigation**: Start from the [Home page](https://docs.xandr.com/) and browse for information about our products, APIs, SDKs, and other resources.
-   **Filtered search**: Search across all content, or drop down the **Filter** menu to narrow your search to the content you're most interested in. Once you see your search results, you can continue to refine based on product, inventory, role, and more.
-   **Clean look and feel**: A look and feel that makes documentation easier and more enjoyable to read.
-   **PDF output**: Export Xandr-branded and beautifully formatted output in PDF format of any topic or set of topics.
-   **Mobile friendly**: Access all the content and the search, browse, and viewing features from any device so you can take it on the go.

## Why Not Move Everything to the Documentation Center? 

We continue to work on that. For now, if you need access to proprietary information, continue to use your existing login information at wiki.xandr.com, or to access our Invest DSP, Monetize SSP, and Curate products.
