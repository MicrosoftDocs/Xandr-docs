# Underspend Budget Rollover





Underspend Budget Rollover is a feature available for
Microsoft Monetize that allows buyers to transfer
unspent budget from a completed flight to a new flight. It will save the
buyer's time from complex budget calculations and manually updating
future flights.



A flight has an underspent budget when its delivered impressions or
revenue is less than their budgeted impressions or revenue. The buyer
has the following flexible options to correct the underspend:

- **Extend**: Buyer can update the underspent flight's end date to a
  future date, so that the flight will continue to serve.

  <b>Warning:</b> If you select this option,
  you won't be able to overlap flight dates, as this feature won't allow
  you to extend to intersect with any other flight date.

  
- **Rollover**: Buyer can add a flight's unspent budget to a current or
  future flight.

## Budget Rollover Procedure

1.  Go to the line item's SMW grid view for your advertiser. Here, you
    will see the new Underspend icon
    in the Flight Budget Delivery
    column.
2.  Select the underspend line item from the LI list. This will take you
    to the exact flights that has underspent budget.
3.  Edit the line item. You will find a
    Rollover button with details about
    how much budget was underspent on each underspent flight.
4.  Click on the Rollover button. This
    will take you to the Rollover
    Underspend screen.
5.  Do one of the following:
    - If you have an active or future flight, then select
      Rollover. You will find a
      dropdown that has all the flights for your line item. Select the
      flight from the dropdown to which you want the budget to be rolled
      over. For example, you can roll over a budget of $1,259.73 from
      Flight 2 to Flight 4.
    - If you don't have any active or future flights, then select
      Extend. You will find an
      End Date field. Update this
      field to a future date and continue your budgeting.
6.  When a flight is rolled over or extended and the modal has been
    submitted, the line item screen updates the relevant flight's budget
    or end date.

    <b>Warning:</b> When a line item is
    updated and re-rendered, the total budget might not reflect the
    underspend changes.
