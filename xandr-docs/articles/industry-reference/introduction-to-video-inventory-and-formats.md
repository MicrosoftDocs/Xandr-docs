# Introduction to Video Inventory and Formats





## What is in-stream video?

In-stream video creatives are played in video players on web pages. They
are played before, in the middle of, or after other video content, and
use VAST XML to ensure proper rendering in the players.





## What is out-stream video?

Out-stream video ads are those that are embedded within the body of an
article, mostly set to auto-play when the reader reaches the part of the
page that contains the ad. The sound is usually not activated unless the
reader hovers over the ads with their mouse. 





## What is in-banner video?

In-banner video creatives are played in banner placements rather than in
video players. The ad buyer must serve the video player code and the
VAST video creative together.





## What is VAST?

VAST stands for Video Ad Serving Template. It is an XML-based video ad
serving protocol that provides a uniform way for video content to be
transferred from ad servers to video players on web pages. VAST allows
for linear video creatives to be served without interactivity. VPAID
modules can be included within a VAST document to facilitate
interactivity.

Pure linear VAST (without VPAID modules) do not allow the buyer to
measure viewability, but do allow the measurement of starts, quartile
completions, and completed views. Pure linear VAST is common in mobile
video. For more details about VAST, see the Interactive Advertising
Bureau's VAST documentation at

## What is VPAID?



VPAID stands for Video Player Ad-Serving Interface Definition. There are
two types of VPAID modules, JavaScript (.js) and Flash (.swf). A VPAID
module  allows a buyer to render JavaScript or Flash on the page in
order to:

- create highly interactive video ad creatives



- measure viewability and verify player attributes

Guidelines for VPAID</a>.





## What is MRAID?

Mobile Rich Media Ad Interface Definitions (MRAID) is a common API
(Application Programming Interface) that allows advertisers to create
HTML5 and JavaScript ads that function seamlessly with the app in which
they are running. It allows users to expand and resize ads, and access
the device’s other features, thus creating a rich, more interactive
environment in which to display ads, instead of siloing static banners
in small areas of the screen.

Mobile Video Tutorial</a> or

## What is VMAP?

Video Multiple Ad Playlist (VMAP) is a form of “ad podding.” It allows
sellers to create commercial breaks, similar to linear broadcast TV, and
is mostly used in long-form content. VMAP is designed to produce rules
around which types of ads can be played together and how they interact
with one another. For example, VMAP can be configured to prevent ads
from competitors (e.g. BMW and Audi) from playing directly next to one
another.
