# Selling Programmatic Guaranteed Deals



Programmatic guaranteed (PG) selling line items provide a workflow for
you to for create and sell PG deals to buyers who use
Xandr Invest and other
partner DSPs.

PG deals combine the certainty of direct sales with the power of
programmatic, enabling publishers to programmatically execute direct
deals with buyers. With PG deals, you have the power of guaranteed
selling within a bidding environment using deal IDs. Instead of using
traditional insertion orders, Xandr PG offerings
unlock the world of direct buying and selling through centralized,
programmatic channels. They also bring the advantage of commitments to
programmatic-oriented buyers and sellers, enabling far greater
predictability for your deals.

PG selling line items are used to create fixed price deals with
specified impression budgets, forecasts in the ad server, reservations,
and guaranteed pacing and delivery.

A PG selling line item defines a negotiated order with a buyer,
including:

- **Revenue Type and Floor Pricing** - how the advertiser has agreed to
  pay you

  - **CPM** ("fixed price" deals) that compete in the auction at a fixed
    price whenever the buyer bids above that price

<!-- -->

- **Priority** - the buyer's ranking in the auction, and also whether or
  not open-auction bids are allowed to compete with the deal line item
  in the auction

- **Budget** - the deal's impression goal target

PG selling line items offer some of the following advantages:

- ability to run and accept programmatic guarantees with programmatic
  buyers
- streamlined execution and reporting of guaranteed media buys
- frequency and reach management within the PG deal
- predictable revenue
