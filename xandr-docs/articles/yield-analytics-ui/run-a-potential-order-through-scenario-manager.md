# Run a Potential Order Through Scenario Manager



You can test sales proposals by creating one or more new order lines for
a product and running them through Scenario Manager. The results enable
you to study the potential revenue consequences of booking new order
lines over the specified time period.

When you create a new order line by selecting a product first, you add
the order line to the system. This means that every existing order line
that's already running during the specified time period will be analyzed
in the scenario.

There are three main steps to using Scenario Manager to run a simulated
new order:

1.  <a

    class="xref">Find the product and add it to Scenario Manager</a>
2.  Modify the new order line you're focusing on
3.  <a

    class="xref">Run and analyze the scenario</a>


## Find the Product and Add it to Scenario Manager

You can add the product to Scenario Manager from the Find Products
page. Or, complete the following process:

1.  On the Scenario Manager page,
    from the Scenario Time frame drop-down menu, specify the time period
    for the scenario. 
2.  In the Change Type drop-down menu,
    choose Select product for order line
    creation and click Go.
3.  On the Find Products page that is displayed, use the filer criteria
    to find the specific product.
4.  Click for the product and select Add to
    Scenario.
5.  Return to Scenario Manager.

The product that you added to Scenario Manager is displayed in
the New Order Lines section.





## Modify the New Order Line You Are Focusing On

Make the changes that you want to simulate.

1.  Select the check box for the product and click
    the Edit button. 
2.  In the Edit Values dialog, make changes to any of the following
    values:
    - Order
    - Advertiser
    - Order Line
    - Start Date
    - End Date
    - Priority
    - Type
    - Pricing Type
    - Sold Price
    - Impressions
    - State
    - Click Update. 
3.  (Optional) Repeat the above steps to create any additional new order
    lines for additional products.

 If you include multiple new order lines in your simulation, you can
apply the same changes to all of them at once by selecting their check
boxes, clicking the Edit button,
making the changes, and
clicking Update.




## Run and Analyze the Scenario

Run the scenario when you have finished editing one or more order lines.
When the scenario is done running, you can analyze it to determine how
it will impact delivery.

1.  Click the Run Scenario button.
    The Scenario link in the top right corner of the page displays
    spinning arrows while Scenario Manager is running.  
     You can let Scenario Manager run in the background while working on
    other tasks and tabs.
2.  When the scenario has completed, click
    the Scenario Summary tab. This
    allows you to view a summary of revenue Gain, Losses, and Net
    Gain Loss, together with data for the number of order lines, orders,
    and products impacted by the modifications.
