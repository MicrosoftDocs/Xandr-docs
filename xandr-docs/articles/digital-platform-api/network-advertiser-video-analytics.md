## Example

### Create the JSON report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` of `"video_analytics_network_advertiser"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the format in which the data should be returned (`csv`, `excel`, or `html`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md).

```
$ cat video_analytics_network_advertiser

{"report":
    {
        "report_type":"video_analytics_network_advertiser",
        "columns":[
            "hour",
            "seller_member_id",
            "campaign_id",
            "imps",
            "starts",
            "75_pcts",
            "completions",
            "cost_per_video_complete",
            "served"
        ],
        "report_interval":"last_48_hours",
        "format":"csv"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the reporting service

`POST` the JSON request to get back a report ID.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X post -d @video_analytics_network_advertiser "https://api.appnexus.com/report?advertiser_id=690"

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"09b6979a6a4c3805bdac8921378d3622"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service

Make a `GET` call with the report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the reporting data to a file (described in the next step).

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=09b6979a6a4c3805bdac8921378d3622'

{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report":{
         "name":null,
         "created_on":"2010-05-25 19:15:48",
         "json_request":"{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"video_analytics_network_advertiser\",\"columns\":
          [\"hour\",\"seller_member_id\",\"campaign_id\",\"imps\",\"starts\",\"75_pcts\",
          \"completions\",\"cost_per_video_complete\",\"served\"],\"row_per\":
          [\"hour\",\"seller_member_id\",\"campaign_id\"],
          \"report_interval\":\"last_48_hours\",\"filters\":[{\"advertiser_id\":\"690\"}]}}",
         "url":"report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592"
      },
      "execution_status":"ready"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and report ID in the `url` field of the response to your previous `GET` call. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the file format that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!NOTE]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592' > /tmp/video_analytics_network_advertiser.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
