When you create a

title="You create augmented line items (ALIs) to define your financial relationship with an advertiser, set up targeting for an advertising campaign, and schedule your advertisements to run.">line
item</a>, you specify the inventory you'd like to target, the budget
you'd like to spend over the flight, how to track revenue, and how to
use Xandr optimization. You also have the option
to split up the line item inventory using **programmable splits**, which
further target subsets of that total inventory, allocate the specified
budget to different targets, and distribute creatives. The targeting on
the line item acts as a filter, so impressions must match the criteria
specified by the line item before they'll be passed on to splits.

You define a split by specifying the inventory you want available for
it, using any combination of split targeting specifications. These
include geography, inventory performance, and segment information. If
you choose, you can also specify bidding or valuation rules, budget
allocations, bidding priority, and/or creative selection for each split.

The following resources explain how splits work, how to set them up,
what the key metrics are, and how to change existing splits in groups or
individually. They also address FAQs associated with using splits.
