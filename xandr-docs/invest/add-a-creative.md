# Microsoft Invest - Add a creative

You can add a creative by either uploading a spreadsheet or the creative files directly from your computer. Only secure content is supported.

To serve on our platform, all creatives must adhere to our creative guidelines and specifications, creative standards, and other guidelines that apply to all creative types. For more information, see [Creative Guidelines and Specifications](creative-guidelines-and-specifications.md), [Creative CTV Guidelines and Specifications](creative-ctv-guidelines-and-specifications.md), and [Creative Standards](creative-standards.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When uploading in the UI, the total size of any hosted banner and video creatives should not exceed 1 GB. The current maximum size for creatives that can be uploaded through the API is approximately 220 MB. It is advisable to use the UI to upload creatives, particularly videos.
