# Key Value Analytics Report





The Key Value Analytics report shows you the information associated with
your network's defined targeting keys and values.

Impressions with key/value targeting will serve and be reported only for
those impressions that were logged by a placement tag containing the
kw\_ prefix on the key name. For example, a placement tag containing
`keyname=value1` will not serve and therefore not be logged, whereas a
placement tag containing `kw_keyname=value1` will serve and be logged.
This applies to GET-based query-string ad calls with the following tag
types: `/tt`, `/ttj`, `/fpt,` `/jpt`, `/pt`, `/ptv`, `/ssptv`, `/mtj`,
`/map`, `/mob`, `/prebid/amp`,` /vmap`, `/ssvmap`.


<b>Note:</b> **Xandr
Seller Tags:** When using
<a href="seller-tag/seller-tag.md"
class="xref" target="_blank">Xandr's seller
tag</a> (AST), omit the `kw_` prefix. AST has the keyword object in the
body of the request, so the prefix is not needed.



Not all impressions from key/value targets will be included in reports.
To be included, the targets must meet the following criteria:

- Key must be pre-defined.
- Value must be pre-defined OR targeted by at least one
  line item.
- Value is not a numeric range (greater than or less than).
- Value does not include a wildcard.

Time Frame

All dates and times are given in UTC.

**Time Ranges**

Time ranges define the time period of the data extracted for the report.
The following is a complete list of time ranges available for reports.

However, all time ranges are not available for every report.



- Custom
- Current Hour
- Last Available Day
- Last Hour
- Today
- Last 24 Hours
- Last 48 Hours
- Yesterday
- Last 2 Days
- Last 7 Days
- Last 7 Available Days
- Last 14 Days
- Last 14 Available Days
- Last 30 Days
- Last 30 Available Days
- Last Month
- Last 100 Days
- Last 365 Days
- Quarter to Date
- Month to Date
- Month to Yesterday
- Lifetime



**Intervals**

Intervals determine how your data is grouped together into rows in the
report response. The following is a complete list of intervals available
for reports. However, all intervals are not available for every report.



- Hourly: Data is grouped into rows by the hour.
- Daily: Data is grouped into rows by the day.
- Monthly: Data is grouped into rows by the month.
- Cumulative: Data is grouped together in one figure, covering the
  entire selected time range.



For more information about how quickly reporting data is processed, see
<a href="availability-of-reporting-data.md" class="xref">Availability
of Reporting Data</a>.

Time ranges including dates occurring more than 45 days ago

If you create a Key Value Analytics report with the Range field set to
Custom (where the end date is more
than 45 days from today), your report (regardless of metrics included)
will be added to a special queue for "resource-intensive" reports. As a
result, the report may take longer than usual to complete. In addition,
this resource-intensive report may, due to the amount of data being
requested, fail before being completed. If your report fails to
complete, you will receive a notification. If your report request fails,
you can:

- rerun the report at a later time.
- use a report type other than Key Value Analytics.
- alter the way you structure your reports (if possible) so they do not
  include dates greater than 45 days ago.

If you are frequently requesting Key Value Analytics reports which
include dates longer than 45 days ago, you may need to consider running
these reports via the API, caching the data and using <a
href="xandr-api/bulk-reporting-feeds.md"
class="xref" target="_blank">Bulk Reporting Feeds</a> or <a
href="log-level-data/log-level-data-feeds.md"
class="xref" target="_blank">Log-Level Data Feeds</a> (LLD). See
<a href="dimensions-metrics-filtering-and-grouping.md"
class="xref">Dimensions, Metrics, Filtering, and Grouping</a> for more
details on how to alter your reports to avoid these issues.

Data Retention Period

Data in this report is retained for 14 months. After 100 days, you are
no longer able to report on hourly data. However, daily, monthly and
cumulative intervals are still available.



<b>Important:</b> Lifetime Analytics Data
Retained for 14 Months

In some cases Analytics reports can show delivery that does not match
statistics shown elsewhere in Microsoft Invest for a
given advertiser or publisher. This is due to the fact that Analytics
reporting data is purged after 14 months, whereas the data from
QuickStats and Billing reports is kept indefinitely.



**Currency 2.0**





<b>Note:</b> By enabling
Currency 2.0, you can select a
currency for each individual report if you prefer not to use
USD as the default currency. The
report will show all the monetary fields in your report using the
selected currency. For example, if you select
Advertiser, click the
Currency 2.0 toggle to enable it, and
select Japanese Yen (JPY) from the
Currency menu, the report will show
all monetary data in JPY, including data associated with child objects
such as line items.





Dimensions



<b>Important:</b> The
**Filter?** column shows whether a
dimension can be used as a filter as well as being used to group by.

To Run Your Report

Follow these steps to run your report.

1.  Select Reporting from the
    appropriate top menu (depending on how your account has been
    configured).
    1.  Or, from the Publishers top menu, click on
        Prebid
        Server Premium \>
        Analytics \>
        Prebid Server Analytics
2.  Select the relevant report from the list. The
    Report screen shows the available
    filters, dimensions, and delivery options for the report. The
    selections you make here will determine what report data is
    delivered to you, and how.
    

    <b>Important:</b> For an explanation of
    how grouping and filtering work, see
    <a href="dimensions-metrics-filtering-and-grouping.md"
    class="xref">Dimensions, Metrics, Filtering, and Grouping</a>.

    
3.  Select the relevant filters to limit the data displayed to just the
    information you want. For example, rather than running a report that
    shows impressions for all inventory sources, you may want to list
    results for just a select few. When you select a filter (by clicking
    Edit), a selection panel appears.
    Select items in the **Available** list (left), then click
    Add to include them in the
    **Chosen** list (right).
4.  Group by Dimension. Grouping allows you to display rows of data in
    the order you prefer.
    

    <b>Warning:</b> The more dimensions you
    group by, the larger the data set that is returned. Larger data sets
    can take substantially longer to process. Be sure to group using
    only the dimensions you need.

    
5.  Choose a delivery option. Once you've selected your filters and
    grouped by your chosen dimensions, you need to choose a delivery
    method. Available delivery methods include:
    - **Run now, show results in screen**: For smaller amounts of data,
      you may want to view the report as soon as possible in your
      browser. You can download the report in XLSX, CSV, Excel/TSV and
      JSON format. However, there is a limit of 100,000 rows per report
      when downloading as XLSX and Excel file.
    - **Run in background, notify me when results are ready to view**: A
      popup notification will let you know when the report is ready to
      view or download.
      

      <b>Tip:</b> The maximum size of the
      report that can be downloaded from the UI is 100 MB. Also, there
      is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when downloading as XLSX and
      Excel file. If the size of the report is more than that, you can
      try to download it using the <a
      href="xandr-api/report-service.md"
