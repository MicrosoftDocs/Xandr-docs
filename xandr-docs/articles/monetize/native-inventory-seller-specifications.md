# Microsoft Monetize - Native Inventory Seller Specifications

[Buying Native Inventory](buying-native-inventory.md) provides instructions for a global approach in which you reach all sellers simultaneously with a single campaign. Scaling is the approach we recommend over using any of the seller-specific settings shown here.

Sellers of native ad inventory define requirements you must meet to serve creatives on their inventory. The specifications on this page outline the requirements for individual sellers and allow you to compare requirements across the various sellers if you want to target only specific sellers. This page might also help troubleshoot if your
creatives aren't serving on the sellers you're expecting.

## Creative settings

Creatives that will serve on native inventory require specific settings when the creative is added. To add a creative, navigate to the **Creative Manager** screen. Click
**Create New** and create a single creative.

## Inventory targeting

When you set up your line item or campaign you need to target your inventory to reach the seller's inventory. See [Buy-Side Targeting](buy-side-targeting.md) for more information.

## Settings by seller

Shown below are seller-specific guidelines and requirements that you must follow to serve on that seller's inventory. All sellers listed here use a **Type** of **Native**.

If a parameter is not mentioned in the tables below, enter whatever values make sense for your line item or campaign. Any value entered in a field listed as "Not supported"
will be ignored. For detailed information on additional fields and uploading a native creative see [Add a Creative](add-a-creative.md) and [Add Creatives in Bulk](add-creatives-in-bulk.md). You can also review our [Native Sell-Side Best Practices](https://download.microsoft.com/download/e/e/5/ee544211-092a-45c4-8076-57b5c5aaceb3/28%20Dec%202023/Sell-Side-Native-Best-Practices.pdf).

Do not use JavaScript piggyback pixels on native creatives. Only image pixels can be used on native creatives.

  situations.

- **Tell a story**: Use context words with time, motion or insight. Make the user want to find out more; the more words, the more interactions.

L'Agora native adspaces or widgets are displayed alongside page content,
which provide superior interaction and engagement to traditional display
advertising. As a buyer, when you set up a line item or
campaign to buy L'Agora, you will be bidding on a slot within the
widget.

| Creative Guidelines and Best Practices |  |
|---|---|
| Text | - We highly recommend short text that is easy to understand with attractive offers.<br> - May not contain contact details as telephone number.<br> - Do not overuse capital letters or exclamation marks. |
| Images | - Images must be clearly relevant to the product or service being advertised.<br> - There should be a clear, simple, attractive, and logical link between the image and the copy.<br> - Avoid images with text embedded directly in the image. The text could easily be distorted depending on the adjustments made when the image is rendered.<br> - Images that represent your target (images of people) generate high engagement.<br> - Images that represent your product perform well. Please do not mislead users by showing products that are not available or are not the ones that you are selling.<br> - Sexually suggestive images are not allowed. Images should be appropriate for a general audience.<br> - Opt for bright, eye-catching images. Avoid black and white images, as they will tend to blend in with the other elements of the galleries around them.<br> - The resolution of the image is important. Low quality images will appear blurry and adversely affect the impact of the ad.<br> - Images must not contain your logo.<br> - Images must not have borders.<br> - Images must be static (no movement). |

| Recommendations and Guidelines |  |
|---|---|
| **General Recommendations** | - Please note that a semi-transparent overlay with your text is placed over the image. It occupies approximately 300x100 pixels in the lower image area.<br> - Our headline 1 line and the description = 2 lines<br> - Only German language |
| **Teaser Text Guidelines** | - No special characters in your text<br> - No exclamation marks |
| **Image Guidelines** | - No purely text-based graphics<br> - No plain text as image<br> - No frame around your image<br> - No pure logo as image<br> - No important image component in the margin, as image can be scaled on smaller screens. Position important parts centrally.<br> - Image has to be static, not animated = GIF/JPEG 40KB maximum. |
