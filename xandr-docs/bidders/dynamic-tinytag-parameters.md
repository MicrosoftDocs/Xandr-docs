# Dynamic TinyTag parameters

A TinyTag ID is associated to various static data in the Xandr database. Some of the parameters associated with the TinyTag can be dynamically added or overwritten at the time of the TinyTag Request, or ad call.

Identification either by ID or by member and codeÂ (see [Calling TinyTags Via Codes instead of ID](dynamic-tinytag-parameters.md#calling-tinytags-via-codes-instead-of-id) below) are required parameters in a TinyTag. Size is also required if it was not pre-associated with the TinyTag ID. All other parameters are optional.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|--|--|--|
| `id` | The ID generated by the [Tinytag Service](tinytag-service.md).| `id=131` |
| `member` | Instead of ID, a TinyTag can be referenced by the member ID and "inv_code". | `member=48` |
| `cb` | Cachebuster. |  |
| `inv_code` | Same as "code" from the TinyTag Service. Can be used to reference a TinyTag along with "member". | `inv_code=testcase` |
| `default_tag_id` | Created via the [Member Service](member-service.md), this is the default ID if the member is known but the "inv_code" is not. This parameter can also be used to override a preset default_tag_id. | `default_tag_id=456` |
| `pubclick` | Publisher-supplied URL for third-party click tracking.<br>**Note**: If you include the `pubclick` parameter, it must be the last parameter in the string. Any parameters that are added following `pubclick` will prevent the creative from clicking through correctly. | `pubclick=https%3A//click.adserver.com` |
| `debug` | Used to run a debug impression.<br>**Note**: In a debug impression, notify requests will not be sent and `userdata_json` commands will not be executed. | `debug=1` |
| `test` | Used to run a test auction. Xandr does not transaction the impression in a test auction and nothing is logged. The content of the ad is also ignored. | `test=1` |
| `debug_node` | Used on a debug impression to direct the bid request to a specific bidder instance. Set debug_node to the id of the bidder instance from the [Bidder Instance Service](bidder-instance-service.md). | `debug_node=25` |
| `size` | Required if not already set on the TinyTag. This parameter will NOT override a preset size format; widthXheight. | `300x250` |
| `referrer` | The URL of the page containing the TinyTag.<br>**Note**: If Xandr detects that this URL misrepresents the inventory (i.e., it is not the actual URL for the impression), we may turn off this feature for the TinyTag. For more details about prohibited sell-side practices, see [Part of Service Policies](../policies-regulations/index.yml). | `https%3A//mysite.com` |
| `age` | Can pass numerical age, birth year, or hyphenated age range. | `56, 1974, or 25-35` |
| `gender` | Possible values: m, f for male, female | `m` |
| `reserve` | The reserve price for this inventory. This parameter WILL override a preset price. | `5.00` |
| `qsdata` (Xandr's platform API Only) | Arbitrary data that will be passed verbatim to the bidder (optional) | `yourdatahere` |
| `flash` | Does the user have flash installed? Possible values: 1 or 0. | `1` |
| `within_iframe` | Will this ad ever be served inside an iframe? Possible values: 1 or 0. | `1` |
| `debug_timeout` | Maximum time (in milliseconds) that the impression bus will wait for bid responses after the bid request is sent. Bidders that do not respond within the timeout window will receive a "Connection throttled, failed, or timed out" error. The value used in production (and default in the sand environment) is **2000 ms**, but may be overridden in the sand environment by passing in a different value for timeout.  <br>**Note**: The timeout override is only used when running a debug impression. | `timeout=100` |
| `position` | The position of the tag on the page. Possible values: 'above' (above the fold) or 'below'. | `position=above` |
| `truncate_ip` | If `1` or `true`, the last octet of the user's IP address will be truncated in the bid request. Use this flag for ad tags in jurisdictions where IP address is considered personally identifiable information. (The full IP address will continue to be used for operational purposes and security, of course.) For more details about Privacy and Xandr's platform, see Archive 2022 - Privacy and the Xandr Platform. | `truncate_ip=1` |
| `prevent_rtb` | Indicates if non-deal RTB should be blocked. Possible values:<br>`0`: Use Xandr's platform API settings.<br>`1`: All RTB is blocked and Xandr's platform API settings are ignored.<br>If both `prevent_rtb` and `prevent_deals` are set to `1`, no bid requests will be sent. | `prevent_rtb=1` |
| `prevent_deals` | Indicates if all deals should be blocked. Possible values:<br> - `0`: Use Xandr's platform API settings<br> - `1`: All deals are blocked and Xandr's platform API settings are ignored.<br>If both `prevent_rtb` and prevent_deals are set to `1`, no bid requests will be sent. | `prevent_deals=0` |
| `gdpr` | Indicates if GDPR regulations or TCF logics are applied, or whether a user is located in a GDPR impacted country (EEA country). | `1 if yes, 0 if no.` |
| `gdpr_consent` | Indicates the actual IAB GDPR consent string. It implies which TCF vendors are permitted to process personal data and under which conditions. | `CO2jXwtO2jXwtB7AAAENAtC4AIAAAEJAAAqIAQAAAAAEAIAAAAACAAA.YAAAAAAAAAA` |
| `gpp` | Indicates the actual IAB GPP consent string. It implies which vendors are permitted to process personal data and under which conditions. | `gpp=DBACNYA~CPXxRfAPXxRfAAfKABENB-CgAAAAAAAAAAYgAAAAAAAA~1YNN` |
| `gpp_sid` | Indicates which regulation/s or GPP logic/s are to be applied, or whether a user is located in a country (EEA country) with a framework that is part of the GPP. | `gpp_sid=6,7` |

## Example usage

**TinyTag using only ID:**

```
https://ib.adnxs.com/tt?id=156
```

**TinyTag passing additional info: Dynamic data: age=29, gender=male**

```
https://ib.adnxs.com/tt?id=156&age=29&gender=male
```

**TinyTag with query string data**

> [!NOTE]
> If you're passing querystring variables into the qsdata parameter, be sure to encode the string of data as shown here.

`likes=cheese`  

`puid=322DD1BF-B288-4271-BCA4`

```
https://ib.adnxs.com/tt?id=156&qsdata=likes%3Dcheese%26puid%3D322DD1BF-B288-4271-BCA4
```

### Calling TinyTags via codes instead of ID

In situations where a TinyTag cannot be called via the TinyTag ID, you can call a TinyTag by a member-defined field called "inv_code". This alphanumeric code is with the [TinyTag Service](tinytag-service.md).

**A sample TinyTag code call:**

```
https://ib.adnxs.com/tt?member=1&inv_code=abcdef
```

**TinyTag using GDPR:**

```
https://ib.adnxs.com/getuid?
https://somedomain.com&gdpr=1&uid=$UID&gpdr_consent=CO2jXwtO2jXwtB7AAAENAtC4AIAAAEJAAAqIAQAAAAAEAIAAAAACAAA.YAAAAAAAAAA
```
