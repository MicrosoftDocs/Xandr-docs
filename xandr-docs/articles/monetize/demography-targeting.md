# Demography Targeting





<b>Note:</b> This feature is currently
available for selected clients only. If you want this feature to be
enabled, please reach out to your Xandr Account
Manager.



Occasionally, publishers pass the age or gender of users in the query
string of their ad calls. In these cases, you can target users based on
this information.



<b>Warning:</b> User age and gender are passed
for a small portion of impressions. Targeting specific age groups and/or
genders will drastically limit reach.



1.  In the Demographicssection in the
    Audience & Location Targeting
    section of the augmented line item, click the pencil icon next to
    **Demographics**. (For a standard line item or
    campaign, this setting is located in the
    Targeting settings.)
2.  By default, any age or gender is targeted. For **Age**, you can
    narrow your targeting to only specific preset age ranges, or you can
    define custom age ranges.
3.  For **Gender**, you can narrow your targeting to one gender or the
    other.



<b>Tip:</b> If you target specific ages or a
specific gender, you should consider selecting **Allow unknown age** or
Allow unknown gender as well to avoid
severely restricting reach.
