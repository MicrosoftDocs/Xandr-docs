# Creative Audit Best Practices



The creative audit process ensures that all creatives served on the
Xandr platform meet the requirements of
publishers wishing to expand their trusted network of partners.



This process takes time and manpower because the human auditing process
is very meticulous. To reduce the audit turnaround time, you should
consider the following best practices:

- Submit your creatives early.

  We recommend submitting creatives at least a week ahead of your flight
  dates. While it takes only one business day for a creative to be
  audited, submitting it early will allow you to address any issues that
  might be identified during the audit process. This will also give you
  time to make sure your creatives are compliant with all policies that
  might hinder them from serving on desired sites or reduce spend.
  Submitting creatives early is especially important during holidays or
  before known periods of increased advertising volume.

- Pace your creative submissions.

  When submitting a large number of creatives for audit, you should
  submit them over an extended period of time. Pacing submissions over
  the course of the day maintains the health of our audit queue and
  allows us to deliver on our SLA for all members. Bulk submissions can
  cause audit delays for all members on the platform, including you. If
  a bulk submission is too large, Xandr will
  de-prioritize it to reduce delays across the ecosystem. This causes
  delays in audit times of the de-prioritized creatives.

- Avoid automated submissions.

  Xandr highly discourages using scripts that
  automatically submit creatives for audit. We have found that this
  practice leads to complications for both Xandr
  and its clients.

  Bulk submissions can occur as a result of glitches in these scripts.
  These bulk submissions often will not be identified as a mistake until
  many of the creatives have already been audited, which may lead to
  high or unprojected audit fees. This may also hinder the audit queue,
  causing delays to all submissions. Even when intentional, it is common
  for automatically submitted creatives to have technical issues that
  may result in a Xandr audit failure, such as
  incorrect click-through issues and rotating stock creatives. By
  avoiding automatic queue submissions, you ensure that all creatives
  are ready to be audited at the time of submission, decreasing the
  number of rejected creatives submitted for audit.

- Stay in contact with your Xandr representative
  or the Audit Client Services team.

  We understand that bulk submissions are sometimes necessary. When you
  need to submit a large number of creatives for audit, you should
  always keep Xandr informed.
  

  Note: With forewarning, we will be
  able to devote additional resources to ensuring your creatives are
  audited as quickly as possible, and keep you up to date if we see
  problems with your bulk creative uploads. You will not run the risk of
  having your creatives de-prioritized or completely removed from our
  queue.
