# Object limits - FAQ

This page provides answers to frequently asked questions about object limits.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the [Object Limit Service](object-limit-service.md) to view your limits and proactively monitor your usage.

## What is an Object?

Xandr considers an object to be those elements used in an auction such as creatives and domains in a domain list. You can see the complete list in [API Usage Constraints](api-usage-constraints.md).

## Why is there a limit on Objects?

We store all Objects in memory on our impression bus servers. This is done to ensure the lookup for those objects at auction time is minimized to ensure the auction runs as fast as possible.

## How can I determine what my Object Limits are?

Xandr provides a read-only API service ([Object Limit Service](object-limit-service.md)) that can be used to see what your limits are. Note that default limits differ depending on whether you are a bidder (`user_type` is "bidder") or a member under a bidder (`user_type` is `"member"`).

## How will I know that I am approaching my limit for an object?

We send you an email notification when you reach 85% of your limit for an object, another when you reach 95% of your limit, and a third email when you reach 100% of your limit.

## How can I receive notifications when I am approaching the limit?

You can add your email address to the `object_limit_notify_email` field in the Bidder object. This can be done using the [Bidder Service](bidder-service.md). You can add multiple emails to this field using a comma-separated list.

You will receive an email notification when you reach 85% of your limit for an object, another when you reach 95% of your limit, and a third email when you reach 100% of your limit.

## What if I reach my limit for an object?

When you approach or reach your limit for domain lists or profile target, you should remove inactive, unused, or unnecessary objects.

- To remove domains from a domain list, use the [Domain List Service](domain-list-service.md), to update the `domains` array.
- To remove a certain target from a profile, use the [Enhanced Bidder Profiles](enhanced-bidder-profiles.md) to update the relevant targeting field.

When you approach or reach your limit for creatives, you should remove non-expired creatives. Non-expired creatives have the `is_expired` field set to `false`.

> [!NOTE]
> Removing expired creatives will not impact your creative count.

To remove a creative, you make a `DELETE` call to the [Creative Service](creative-service.md).

If you need help identifying objects to delete, contact support for assistance.

## How can I get my Object Limits adjusted?

In exceptional cases, a limit may be temporarily lifted by a small amount at the discretion of our engineering team. Contact your
Xandr representative to discuss this option or [open a support case](https://help.xandr.com/).
