# Microsoft Invest - Reconcile your seller statement with reports

## Run the seller billing report

In the UI, run the Selling Billing Report to view your Seller Revenue on your seller activity statement. You can also use the Selling Billing Report to confirm your (Managed) Ad Serving fee on your invoice.

1. On the Member reporting screen, select **Selling Billing Report** in the **Type** dropdown.
1. Enter a date in the **Range** field that corresponds to the period start and end date on your invoice, and then select **Run report**.

## Confirm invoice values (selling)

The (Managed) Ad Serving Fee is the amount to be paid to Microsoft Advertising for kept, blank, default, and PSA impressions (which includes filtered requests). The sum of the **Total Imps*** in the **Blank**, **Default**, **Kept**, and **PSA** rows should match the value in the **Billable Units** column on your invoice. To calculate the charge, multiply the sum of Total Imps\* where **Impression Type** is **Blank**, **Default**, **Kept**, or **PSA** by the CPM ad serving fee in your Microsoft Advertising contract. The value you have calculated should match the value in the **Amount** column on your invoice.

\*Total Imps = Imps + Filtered Requests
