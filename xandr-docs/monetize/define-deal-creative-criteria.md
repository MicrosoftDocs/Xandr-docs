# Define deal creative criteria

Setting deal creative criteria for your Programmatic Guaranteed selling line item (PG selling line item) allows you to override you network and publisher ad quality settings for your Programmatic Guaranteed deal (PG deal).

By default, PG selling line items use your network and publisher ad quality settings. Brands, creatives, and creative attributes that your ad quality settings aren't already banning are otherwise allowed.

Specify creative attributes allowed for your deal.
