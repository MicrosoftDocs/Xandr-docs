# Video Players



This page describes the Xandr video player
offerings, as well as ideal use cases and limitations of each player.

Instream versus Outstream Video

Instream video refers to video advertising for which publishers provide
their own players (usually to house their own content).

Outstream video refers to video advertising that is dependent on a
player provided as part of the video placement architecture which has
zero footprint and expands as needed to host an ad on the page.

This page concerns the various player options we provide for outstream
video (including outstream mediation) when players are not hosted by the
publisher.
