#  Microsoft Invest - partnership details screen

On the Partnership details screen you can review and manage your
relationship with a specific seller. You can track overall spend trends,
view your top brands on the seller's inventory, view the seller's top
publishers from whom you have purchased inventory, view active and
pending deals, and communicate with the seller to negotiate a deal.

## Getting to the partnership details screen

To reach this screen, select
**Inventory \>  Partners**.

## Viewing seller contact info and description

Click on a seller and click **Show
Profile** to view profile information the seller has provided,
including the main contact's name, phone number, email address, and a
description of their business. You can contact the seller directly by
sending a message within the **Activity Stream**. For more information
about the **Activity Stream**, see [Communicating with the seller](#communicating-with-the-seller).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the seller has not entered their contact's name, phone number, email address, or a description of their business, then this information will not be available.

## Viewing your performance on the seller's inventory

Click on a seller to view statistics about how your ad campaigns are performing on the seller's inventory. These statistics update every 24 hours.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not purchased any inventory from the seller, there will be no information to display in the dashboard.

### Spend

A graph displays spend from all transactions between you and the seller
within the last 30 days. You can use this graph to monitor your activity
on the seller's inventory. If you are targeting an active deal, this
graph can help give you insight into the deal's effectiveness. Since the
spend displayed here reflects all transactions, this graph will not help
you keep track of the spend from a specific deal.

There is a data point for every day. Hover over a data point to see the
date it represents and the spend amount for that day.

### Spend by top publishers

A table lists the seller's top publishers from whom you have purchased
inventory, listed in order from most to least spend. This information
tells you which of the seller's publishers you are performing best on.

## Communicating with the seller

In the **Activity Stream**, the
**Messages** tab shows messages between
you and the seller along with the number of days since the message was
posted. You can use the **Activity Stream** to introduce yourself to a
new seller, request changes to your eligibility, allowed payment types,
and targeting access, or discuss why your targeting access isn't working
for you.

In this section you can:

- **Send a message:** Send the seller a message by typing into the field
  at the top of the section, and then clicking
  **Post**. When you post a new message,
  the system sends a notification to the contact in the seller's
  profile.
- **View last update information:** Text at the top of the section will
  note when the **Activity Stream** was last updated.
- **Hide Activity Stream:** Click the Hide Activity Stream icon
  ("**\<**") to collapse the section and provide more working space.

Click on the **Notifications** tab in the
**Activity Stream** to view system messages.

edit the deal.

You can run a report to see how your deals are performing. See [Buy-Side Reporting on Deals](buy-side-reporting-on-deals.md) for more information.

## Viewing packages

**Packages** display the number of
packages available to you. Sellers package their inventory to provide
special access to their premium inventory, discounted rates, or other
opportunities. Click the number under
**Packages** to review each package's
description, price, and sizes in the **Package
Marketplace** to determine if you are interested. Then, add the packages you are interested in to your cart to generate deals. For more
information on generating a deal from a package, see [Get Deals from Seller Packages](get-deals-from-seller-packages.md).

## Requesting a custom deal

If you see a package in the **Package
Marketplace** that interests you but needs some modification, you
can send the seller a message with your request. Click
**Request a Custom Deal**, explain your
need, and then click Submit to post
your message in the **Activity Stream** on
the **Partner Details** page
**(Inventory \> Partners)**. Use the
**Activity Stream** to continue your
negotiation with the seller. If the seller agrees to the change you
requested, you will need to generate a deal from a package (see below).
The seller will then modify your deal to meet your needs.

## Generating a deal from a package

If you are interested in the packaged inventory, you can generate deals
between you and the seller. Click **Add to
Cart** near the desired packages, then click
**Get Deals** to create deals that you can
target. For step-by-step instructions, see [Get Deals
from Seller Packages](get-deals-from-seller-packages.md).

target deals using line item deal targeting. For more information, see [Deal Targeting (ALI)](deal-targeting-ali.md).
