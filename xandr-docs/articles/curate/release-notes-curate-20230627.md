# June 27, 2023: new advertiser and insertion order screens in the Microsoft curate UI

With new screens accessible from the `Package` menu, curators can now manage and keep an eye on their advertisers and insertion orders more easily. While a new settings panel enables you to easily examine how they're set up, new search options make it simple to identify the advertiser or insertion order you need. Additionally, new analytics enable you to quickly track deliveries.
