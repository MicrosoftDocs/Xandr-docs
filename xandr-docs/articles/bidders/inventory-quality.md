# Inventory Quality



Xandr both controls inventory quality across the
platform with baseline Inventory Content Standards, and gives buyers the
tools to choose the type of inventory they want through our auditing
system.

In addition to our baseline inventory content standards, some inventory
(platform-reviewed) has been audited and tagged with content categories,
sensitive attributes, and intended audiences by a
Xandr team. Selling members of the platform are
also given the option to provide this data themselves.

**Platform-Reviewed:** Xandr's platform
operations team has reviewed the highest-traffic domains on our
platform; currently about 70% of volume. Metadata is provided on a
domain level.

**Sellers:** Auditing may also be done by the network, aggregator, or
exchange that represents the publisher. This metadata is provided on a
tag level.

**Toolbars, browser plug-ins and related
inventory:** <a href="https://wiki.xandr.com/display/policies/Policies+for+Buying"
class="xref" target="_blank">Xandr's policy</a>
only allows browser plug-ins that provide informed consent to the user
before installation and that do not modify or overlay publisher ads. We
require that sellers segregate and identify their toolbar inventory
within the Xandr system so that we can monitor
compliance. Bidders can opt out of receiving requests from toolbar
inventory entirely by excluding the toolbar inventory attribute in
their <a

class="xref" target="_blank">bidder profile</a>.

Buying Based on Sensitive Attributes and Intended Audience

When targeting inventory, you have the option to target only
Xandr-reviewed inventory or to "trust" the
self-auditing of other Xandr members. When
choosing to target only Xandr-reviewed inventory
there is a trade off between having less reach, but ensuring that you
are running on inventory that meets our requirements. This information
is passed in the inventory_audits array within the bid request. For more
information, see the <a
