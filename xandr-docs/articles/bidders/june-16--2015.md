# June 16, 2015

We are pleased to announce the following enhancements to version 1.16 of the AppNexus ImpBus API.

> [!WARNING]
> In addition to new features, this release includes breaking changes. We will therefore support two versions of the API for the next 60 days, as stated in our [Breaking Changes](./breaking-changes.md) policy.
>
> **Version 1.15**: This version **does not** include breaking changes. The `https://api.adnxs.com` endpoint will continue to point to version 1.15 for 60 days. After that time, this endpoint will point to version 1.16.
>
> **Version 1.16**: This version **does** include breaking changes and new features. For the next 60 days, to use this version, you must point directly to it in your calls, for example, `https://api.adnxs.com/v1.16`.

## Breaking changes

All of the changes described in this section are only present in version 1.16.

### One Supported SSL Endpoint

As of the 1.16 release, the only supported endpoint for ImpBus API users will be the (SSL-enabled) `https://api.adnxs.com`. Non-secure HTTP endpoints will no longer be supported. Other URLs will no longer be supported.

### Stricter JSON Type Checking

Version 1.16 will continue to automatically convert (cast) "integerish" strings to integers. For example, `"123"` will still be converted to `123`.

However, beginning with version 1.16, the API will no longer warn when automatically converting a "non-integer" string such as `"foo"` to `0` when such a string is passed into a field expecting an integer. Instead, it will throw an error and the call will fail.

### Changed error messages

The following error messages are changing:

- Anywhere the message `"Error occured while processing your request"` appears, it's being changed to fix the misspelling in "occurred". The new message will be `"Error occurred while processing your request"`.
- If a database transaction fails, the error message is currently `"SYSTEM::updating`". These messages have been changed to provide more detail, depending on the type of error. The new messages are:
  - `SYSTEM::DEADLOCK_MAX_ATTEMPTS::A database error occurred. Please try your request again.`
  - `SYSTEM::DB_UNKNOWN::A database error occurred. Please try your request again.`

### Changed services

#### Creative service

The following changes are being made to the [Creative Service](./creative-service.md):

- The `thirdparty_page_id` field is now inside the `thirdparty_page` object in both the request and the response.
- A template is now required for every creative. Creatives configured using the previously-deprecated `format` and `media_subtype` elements will no longer function. A non-null `id` is now required in the `template`object for any `PUT` or `POST`.

#### Bidder profile service

The following changes are being made to the [Legacy Bidder Profile Service](./legacy-bidder-profile-service.md).

**Removed fields**

The `inventory_source_targets` field is being removed:

**Targeting region, country, and city will be by ID**

We are changing region, country, and city-based targeting to target by ID. The following fields are being updated.

**Country targets**

The `country_targets` field will be passed in using IDs as follows:

```
"country_targets": [
    {
        "id": 1 // id of US
    },
    {
        "id": 2 // id of AS
    }
]
```

Furthermore, the contents of this field in response to a `GET` call will become:

```
"country_targets": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "United States",
          "code": "US"
        }
      ]
```

To see a list of all of the countries available for targeting, make a `GET` request to `https://api.adnxs.com/country/meta`.

**Region targets**

The `region_targets` field will be passed in using IDs as follows:

```
"region_targets": [
    {
        "id": 1 // ID of NJ region in US
    },
    {
        "id": 2 // ID of NY region in US
    }
]
```

Furthermore, the contents of this field in response to a `GET` call will become:

```
"region_targets": [
       {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "New York",
          "code": "NY",
          "country_name": "United States",
          "country_code": "US"
        }
      ]
```

For a list of the supported regions, you can check the Region Service meta by making a `GET` request to `https://api.adnxs.com/region/meta`.

**City targets**

The `city_targets` field will change slightly to the following (`"region_id"`, an integer, is being replaced by `"region_code"`, a string):

```
"city_targets": [
       {
          "id": 123,
          "name": "Queens",
          "region_name": "New York",
          "region_code": "NY",
          "country_name": "United States",
          "country_code": "US"
        }
      ]
```

To search the City Service for cities that you are interested in targeting, call the service using a name (or part of a name) as shown below. This example will find cities with the string `"New"` in their names.

`curl -bc https://api.``adnxs``.com/city?like_city=New`

**Third-party page access service**

**Changed field type**

In the Third-Party Page Access Service, the type of the `thirdparty_page_id` field is changing from string to integer. This is necessary because Facebook only accepts numeric values in this field.

**Reporting service**

**New method for retrieving reports**

The method for retrieving a report from the [Report Service](./report-service.md) is changing. Beginning with the 1.16 release, the workflow will change to be the same as used by the Console API. Specifically, the steps will be:

1. Create a report by `POST`ing JSON to the [Report Service](./report-service.md). This returns a report ID.
2. Check the status of your report by making a `GET` request to the service using the report ID you received in Step 1.
3. When the `"execution_status"` of the request from Step 2 is `"ready"`, the URL for downloading the report will be in the `"url"` field.
4. Finally, you'll make a `GET` call to the **Report Download Service** using the contents of the `"url"` field to retrieve the report data.

**Report download service**

The `report-download` service now returns more consistent and accurate headers in its responses. For these responses, no JSON is returned. The possible return values are:

- 200: OK.
- 202: Report request accepted and still pending for processing.
- 404: The report ID was not provided.
- 405: Unsupported method was requested (`POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
- 410: Purged; report has been deleted.
- 500: Internal Error. The reporting API returned a malformed response, could not report data, or any other uncaught exceptions.

**Removed service**

The June 16, 2015 is being removed.

**Bidding protocol changes**

We are updating our [Bid Request](./bid-request.md) to remove the following fields:

- `inventory_class`
- `inventory_source_id`

## Non-breaking changes

The changes in this section apply to version 1.15 of the API.

### New services

#### Deal from package service

**New service**

The [Deal From Package Service](./deal-from-package-service.md) allows buyers to create a deal from an existing package.
