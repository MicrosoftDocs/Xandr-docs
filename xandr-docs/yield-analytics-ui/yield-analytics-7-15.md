# Yield Analytics 7.15

Support Period to Log Date - This is an option to select a dynamic date range of Period to Log Date, where the end date would be the log data date. For clients with multiple integrations, the log data date used would be the one furthest back in history.

There were changes made to search delimiters from “,” to “;” in the filters in Analyzer and Reports. This makes it consistent with search page filter delimiters throughout the application.

## Fixes

Scheduling for one report was being applied to multiple reports. Now it will only be applied to the intended report. There has been some slowness in the calendar widget on the Product Visibility screen that has been enhanced.
