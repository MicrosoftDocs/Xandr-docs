# Ad Quality and Creative Standards



Advertisers wish to serve their creatives in as many places as possible.
As a publisher, though, you want to protect your site from creatives
that violate your standards. Since these issues are very related, here
is an overview about how our Creative Standards and Ad Quality profiles
interact.

**Buyers** can opt their creatives into the
Xandr audit process to maximize their reach.

- This includes buyers using our hosted bidder, Xandr
  Monetize, and other technology partners that have built their
  own bidders and integrated with our stack
- We audit both creatives hosted with us as well as third-party tags

Creatives that violate these policies will be removed from the platform, and will be ineligible for both real-time bidding (RTB) and in-network buying. Repeated violation of these policies may result in strikes against offending members.">Creative
  Standards</a>

**Sellers** of inventory can determine the types of creatives that are
allowed to serve on their inventory, including whether or not the
creative is audited by the Xandr team.

- All aggregators, including Microsoft, require creatives to be audited
  by the Xandr team prior to serving on their
  inventory.
- Some ad networks allow unaudited creatives to serve on their inventory
  or a portion of it.
- We also allow sellers to apply trust levels to individual buyers. For
  example, a seller can apply maximum trust to a buyer. The seller will
  then accept all creatives from those buyers, regardless of audit
  status.
- We allow sellers to approve or ban creatives on an individual basis.
