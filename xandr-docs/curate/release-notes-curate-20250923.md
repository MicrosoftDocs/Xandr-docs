# Microsoft Curate - September 23, 2025 - Unified Sign-In with Microsoft account 

Starting October 20, 2025, username/password logins in Microsoft Curate will be retired. All users must sign in with a Microsoft account. This update ensures a consistent and extensible login experience that aligns with Microsoftâ€™s broader security standards and supports current and future business needs. 

Historically, the platform supported two login methods: 
- a local username/password option and Microsoft account sign-in. 
- Maintaining parallel login flows introduced complexity and increased operational overhead, while legacy username/password logins carried higher security risks and compliance challenges. 

With this update, Microsoft Curate adopts a unified sign-in approach, delivering: 

- Simplified access through a single, streamlined login entry point. 
- Improved security by reducing risks associated with legacy credentials. 
- Consistent identity management and permission handling across the Microsoft ecosystem. 
- Enhanced user trust and brand alignment, reflecting modern cloud platform standards.
