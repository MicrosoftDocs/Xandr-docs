# Deal Targeting (ALI)





By selecting Deals in the
Inventory &
Brand Safety Targeting \> Supply
Source subsection of the

more sellers.





## Target Deals and Deal Lists

When you select the Deals option in
the Inventory &
Brand Safety Targeting \> Supply
Source subsection of the
Create New Line Item or
Edit Line Item screen, you will
have the option to target either all the available deals for that line
item, or specific deals from sellers using the configurations detailed
below.

**To target all deals available to you:**

1.  In the
    Inventory &
    Brand Safety Targeting \> Supply
    Source subsection, select
    Deals under
    Supply Source.
2.  Select All Deals.

**To target specific deals available to you:**

1.  In the
    Inventory &
    Brand Safety Targeting \> Supply
    Source subsection, select
    Deals in the
    Supply Source section.

2.  Select Specific Deals.

    A pull-down menu displays with
    Deals selected by default.

3.  To target specific deals, select one of the following targeting
    options and complete the corresponding steps:
    <table id="ID-00004ce5__table_74b9d08f-cf1c-4d03-ba3e-8d73584ec8d4"
    class="table frame-all">
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead class="thead">
    <tr class="header row">
    <th
    id="ID-00004ce5__table_74b9d08f-cf1c-4d03-ba3e-8d73584ec8d4__entry__1"
    class="entry align-left colsep-1 rowsep-1">Targeting Option</th>
    <th
    id="ID-00004ce5__table_74b9d08f-cf1c-4d03-ba3e-8d73584ec8d4__entry__2"
    class="entry align-left colsep-1 rowsep-1">Steps</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody class="tbody">
    <tr class="odd row">
    <td class="entry align-center colsep-1 rowsep-1"
    headers="ID-00004ce5__table_74b9d08f-cf1c-4d03-ba3e-8d73584ec8d4__entry__1"><strong>Deals</strong></td>
    <td class="entry align-left colsep-1 rowsep-1"
    headers="ID-00004ce5__table_74b9d08f-cf1c-4d03-ba3e-8d73584ec8d4__entry__2"><ol
    type="a">
    <li>Search for available deals by name, alias, ID, or code to
    target.</li>
    <li>Include deals by clicking the green
    check, or exclude deals by clicking the <span
    class="ph uicontrol">red dash.
    
    <b>Tip:</b> You can also click the eye button
    to view additional details about the deal such as
    <strong>Currency</strong>, <strong>Type</strong>,
    <strong>Sizes</strong>, <strong>Brands</strong>, <strong>Media
    Types</strong>, <strong>Start Date</strong>, and <strong>End
    Date</strong>.
    </li>
    </ol></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even row">
    <td class="entry align-center colsep-1 rowsep-1"
    headers="ID-00004ce5__table_74b9d08f-cf1c-4d03-ba3e-8d73584ec8d4__entry__1"><strong>Deal
    Lists</strong></td>
    <td class="entry align-left colsep-1 rowsep-1"
    headers="ID-00004ce5__table_74b9d08f-cf1c-4d03-ba3e-8d73584ec8d4__entry__2"><ol
    type="a">
    <li>Search for available deal lists by ID or name to target.</li>
    <li>Include deals by clicking the green
    check, or exclude deals by clicking the <span
    class="ph uicontrol">red dash.</li>
    </ol></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    

    <b>Note:</b>
    You may either include deals OR exclude deals, and deal lists, but
    not both. Include and exclude functionality has to be consistent at
    line item level. For example, you can't include a deal list and
    exclude a deal from the deal list on the line item.

    Deal lists and deals follow the line item and split level targeting
    constraints. If a deal list and associated deals are excluded at the
    line item level, splits will not be able to target that inventory
    regardless of any selections made. Whereas if a deal or deal list is
    included at the line item level, then split targeting will be
    respected.

    

4.  Click Save.





## Target Deals and Deal Lists at the Programmable Split Level



You can specify the deals and/or deal lists to include, or exclude in
programmable splits for the line item. To target specific deals or/and
deal lists for the split:

1.  Select Deals or/and
    Deal Lists under
    Inventory within the
    Select Targeting menu in the
    Programmable Splits section of
    the Create New Line Item and
    Edit Line Item screens.

2.  Click the pen icon next to **Any**
    under Deals or/and
    Deal Lists to go to the
    Edit Split pop-up.

3.  In the Deals/Deal Lists search
    field, enter a **Deal List ID** or **Deal ID**, or **Name** to
    search for deals and deal lists.

4.  From the search result, select the applicable deal list(s) or/and
    deal(s).

    The default in the menu is Include
    Any which includes the selected deal lists or deals for that
    split.

5.  If you would like to exclude deal lists or deals, select
    Exclude All in the menu.

6.  Click Apply to save the
    configuration.



<b>Note:</b> If you're targeting both deal(s)
and deal list(s) within the same split, the boolean logic between them
will be AND.
