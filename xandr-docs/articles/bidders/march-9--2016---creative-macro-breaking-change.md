# March 9, 2016 - Creative Macro Breaking Change



We are making a breaking change to deprecate the `${REFERER_URL}` macro,
effective 60 days from today, on **May 8, 2016**. 

AppNexus will continue to support the encoded
version of this macro, `${REFERER_URL_ENC}`, where it is necessary to
have referrer information passed back to a third-party source. Ensure
that your system configuration is updated to use only the encoded URL
macro.

For more information about what constitutes a breaking change, please
see our <a

class="xref" target="_blank">Breaking Changes Policy</a>. If you have
any questions about this change, please reach out to your
AppNexus representative.
