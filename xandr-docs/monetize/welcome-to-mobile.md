# Microsoft Monetize - Welcome to mobile

As the world transitions toward heavier mobile device usage, learning the ins and outs of mobile buying becomes essential. Luckily, advertising on mobile apps is mostly similar to traditional web advertising (and where it differs, we'll explain those differences - see more below). The documentation in this section is designed to provide you with a solid understanding of how advertising works on mobile apps. Topics we'll cover include:

- The similarities and differences between mobile app and web.
- How to buy mobile inventory from various sources.
- How to work with mobile advertisers, including running cost-per-install offers and managing discrepancies.
- The current technical limitations that lead to different features in mobile app and web.
- How to access mobile-specific features using our APIs.

> [!TIP]
> We've written this section especially for clients who want to work with mobile advertisers and inventory. However, most of what you'll need to do is covered by the existing documentation, so don't forget to look there as well.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Have a specific question in mind? See the [Mobile Buying FAQ](mobile-buying-faq.md).
