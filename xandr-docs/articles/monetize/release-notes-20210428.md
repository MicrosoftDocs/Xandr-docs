# April 28, 2021: Reinforcing Privacy Controls Through a Cookie-Free Domain



Xandr introduced a new domain, adnxs-simple.com,
to facilitate improved consumer privacy controls for no-consent
scenarios. The new domain does not send or read browser cookies on
requests. Clients can leverage the new domain for monetization when
there is no consent to use personal data. Relevant calls initiated by
Xandr will now automatically utilize this new
domain when there is no consent or when cookies are not required for the
function.
