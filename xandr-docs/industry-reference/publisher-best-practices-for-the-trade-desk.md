# Publisher best practices for The Trade Desk

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For additional details, see [The Trade Desk Inventory Policies](https://partner.thetradedesk.com/v3/portal/ssp/doc/InventoryPolicies) which are subject to change as The Trade Desk makes updates to their policies.

This page details best practices for Microsoft Monetize sellers to maximize revenue and optimize their monetization  strategies based on The Trade Desk’s inventory policies.

## Inventory Transparency  

Transparent and accurate signals along with support for the IAB inventory transparency standards such as (app-)ads.txt, sellers.json, and the SupplyChain object are **required**.  

| Guideline | Details |
|---|---|
| Ads.txt and app-ads.txt | The ads.txt IAB standard provides a mechanism for web publishers to list their authorized digital sellers to fight against fraud and misrepresented domains. The app-ads.txt specification is an extension of the original ads.txt standard to meet the requirements for applications distributed through mobile app stores, connected television app stores, or other application distribution channels. For details, see [Ads.txt](https://iabtechlab.com/ads-txt/) in the IAB Tech Lab documentation. In the app-ads.txt or ads.txt files, you must include the variables in the following table.<br/><br/><table><th>Variable</th><th>Description</th><tr><td>OwnerDomain</td><td><ul><li>To indicate page ownership, publishers must add an OwnerDomain variable to all their ads.txt files, using the following syntax: `ownerdomain=xyz.com`. This represents the business domain of the site owner or publisher.</li><li>Unless a ManagerDomain is specified, this value must match the seller's domain used in the sellers.json files and must resolve in a browser without subsequent redirects.</li><li>This value should be the domain for the business entity that collects payment on behalf of the publisher, typically not the domain of a site with ads.</li><li>If there is no business domain for the publisher and they have only a single site, it is acceptable to use that site's domain as the OwnerDomain.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>ManagerDomain</td><td><ul><li>To indicate a publisher outsourced monetization to a sales house, the publisher must add a ManagerDomain variable to all their ads.txt files, using the following syntax: `managerdomain=xyz.com`. Only one ManagerDomain per ads.txt file is allowed per country as per the spec. ManagerDomain should only be used when there is a preferred seller who is not the site owner.</li><li>This value must match the seller's domain used in the sellers.json files and must resolve in a browser without subsequent redirects.</li><li>This value should be the domain for the business entity that collects payment on behalf of the owner that is specified in OwnerDomain.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>App-Ads.txt Roll Out</td><td>Applicable for in-app inventory, especially CTV. To ensure compliance with IAB’s guidelines for Inventory Partner Domain (IPD) implementation, The Trade Desk requires the following practices based on our inventory policies:<br/><ul><li> Publishers must list all authorized Inventory Partner Domains (IPD) in their app-ads.txt file to reflect current inventory share agreements.</li><li>Include an IPD in the bid request only when the inventory is owned or shared by another partner (for example, Content Owner XYZ selling the vMVPD distributor).</li><li> Ensure the App Store URL passed in the bid request reflects the app being declared IAB’s best practices guide is available [here](https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ctv-app-ads-explainer-guide.pdf?mkt_tok=NTI3LUlOTS0zNjQAAAGfYO4y1Nso4W4lzGvHrIqGLZPYZ7tm_8OAzFGoFDmFo-i4NGGRvbKUchqsygkpcxwYPBI0XXb6oUV-YsdF8aN7oENKoJdeNxCBgWt6ZwHgmsKj4I2a) for reference which is aligned to TTD guidelines [here](https://partner.thetradedesk.com/v3/portal/ssp/doc/StandardAdapter?mkt_tok=NTI3LUlOTS0zNjQAAAGfYO4y067Rc9KR_Wy_sBp6XxNRzCRaesJiOpzNY6O42R4J1TEGD7C-pwLIhASfbH5rlAS1m3GvLWm_7Z5H_20yC2TZMtJwczT4CI2ydMZHWmw2Sb7F#adstxt).</li></ul><br/> **NOTE:** These changes will go into effect on February 17th, 2026.</td></tr></table>|
| sellers.json |To transact on The Trade Desk platform, be sure to meet the following requirements for the sellers.json files:<br/><ul><li>All direct integrations must have a non-confidential sellers.json file.</li><li>Intermediary sellers must have their own non-confidential sellers.json files.</li><li>All sellers.json files must be listed on a secure link (HTTPS).</li><li>Seller IDs, names, seller types, and business domains must be listed in the sellers.json file.</li><li>A seller must use a consistent business domain everywhere they are represented, particularly across all exchanges’ sellers.json files.</li><li>Sellers must have the correct seller_type value, that can be one of the following three values listed in the sellers.json spec (PUBLISHER, INTERMEDIARY, BOTH). The decisive criterion for the determination of the seller_type is if the seller is the final payee of the auction or handing payment to another entity.*Note*: For details, see sellers.json in the IAB Tech Lab documentation.</li></ul><br/>**IMPORTANT**: To ensure proper enforcement of the policies, The Trade Desk recommends splitting publisher and intermediary inventory into separate seller IDs (especially for CTV inventory). If direct and resold inventory must be sent through the same seller ID (ideally for only non-CTV), the seller should be designated BOTH and OwnerDomain must be implemented on the O&O properties’ ads.txt files.|

## Bid Request Signals  

| Guideline | Details |
|---|---|
| Support and pass a **Global Placement Identifier** (GPID) |<ul><li>Support GPID for all integration types.</li><li>See [The Trade Desk GPID documentation](https://partner.thetradedesk.com/v3/portal/ssp/doc/InventoryGlobalPlacementID).</li><li>See [Prebid GPID documentation](https://docs.prebid.org/features/pbAdSlot.html)<ul><li>Xandr adapter supports [GPT Pre-Auction module](https://docs.prebid.org/dev-docs/modules/gpt-pre-auction.html) as of Prebid 4.38.0 Release, which is the module responsible for generating GPID -> The module tries to populate the `pbadslot` and `gpid` fields on its own (by default) reading the data from the GAM slots that are present on the page.</li><li>The GPT Pre-Auction module is typically enabled by default in the [Prebid.js Code download screen](https://docs.prebid.org/download.html)</li><li>If the publisher is using Prebid code handled by a managed service provider, they should consult with this provider to check whether they are already using the above module, or to check if the provider can implement the above module in order to begin passing GPID.</li></ul></li><li>[AST Guidelines](../seller-tag/define-tag.md) (see `globalPlacementId`)<ul><li>Publishers need to ensure they are using AST version 0.49.0+ in order to use the globalPlacementId for AST</li></ul></li><li>OpenRTB (server-side integrations) Guidelines<ul><li>Publisher Clients using server-side/OpenRTB based integrations will need to use imp.ext.gpid field to pass Global Placement ID in their OpenRTB request - whereby the GPID value should be a string</li></ul></li><li>Video Tags (PTV, SSPTV) Guidelines<ul><li>Xandr video tags support GPID as a querystring parameter – example: https://ib.adnxs.com/ptv?id=123456789&size=994x250&referrer=msn.com&gpid=GPID123456780</li></ul></li></ul>|
| Video.plcmt adoption |The `video.plcmt` value (introduced in 2023) must be included and accurate according to the IAB definition of in-stream video. In-stream videos must meet the following requirements:<ul><li>In-stream placements are pre-roll, mid-roll, and post-roll ads that are played before, during, or after the streaming video content that the consumer has requested.</li><li>The video should be the primary content on the page in a large, premium, static player.</li><li>The video should not be placed in the middle or at the end of an article.</li><li>The video must be unmuted by default, but browser-specific overrides may mute the player.</li><li>If the video player has the functionality to move to a sticky or floater as the consumer navigates the page, the video must have been unmuted at player start for The Trade Desk to consider it an in-stream placement.</li><li>If the video player can be scrolled out of view while the user consumes other content, then it should not be declared as in-stream (`plcmt=1`).|
| Transaction ID |The transaction ID (passed via `source.tid` or `imp.ext.tid`) must be a common auction identifier across all suppliers throughout the entire supply chain documenting a unique impression transaction. If you're using Prebid.js to call Monetize, make sure to update to the latest version. We've added support for `source.tid` in our adapter, and updating ensures compatibility with this requirement.|
| Clear visibility profiles |Ensure visibility profiles allow for sending of site.page url with the full-page URL including query string, key-value pairs, and UTM parameters.|
| Live Event Signals and Deal Packaging applicable for live event inventory | For inventory to be eligible for TTD's new Live Events/Sports marketplace, we are asking live event inventory owners to pass certain content signals (ID, genre, channel, and title) in their bid requests. These signals will enable TTD buyers to directly target on the event type/sport/league, and pace fluidly across a set of live events in a schedule. (Despite the inclusion of Title and ID, we do not yet support show/game/event-level buying.)<br/>In the case of incomplete or insufficient content signals, we also request inventory owners to set up TTD library deals per sport or league, and only contain live, in-game content.<br/>TTD is continuing to advocate at IAB for additional signals (‘liveness’ signals as well as improved sports and league taxonomies), so stay tuned for that in Q1.<br/>Lastly, we strongly encourage inventory owners to follow the general guidelines to be included in Sellers and Publishers 500+.<br/> **Benefits:** <ul><li> Improve advertiser access: diverse, increased demand from growing live sports marketplace.</li><li>Strong signal fidelity: Higher Deal Quality Score in Deal Desk, higher CPMs and better price discovery.</li><ul> |
| Content Signals applicable for TV and audio inventory | We ask that publishers send content signals for CTV and Audio including genre, season, series, title, episode, production quality, content duration, livestream, network, channel, content rating, content language, and content ID. Where signal is present, we will continue to be able to express increased value to the advertiser.<br/> Please note that we do not target or optimize granular show level signals to respect VPPA.<br/> TTD’s Content Signals Taxonomy is available [here](https://partner.thetradedesk.com/v3/portal/ssp/doc/ContentSignalTaxonomy?mkt_tok=NTI3LUlOTS0zNjQAAAGfYO4y0waAtpaOxI5Ntd2L6a0FyRoQKIn6WW8oTlljnjT_AKtRfa6YXqbxiGr4puO3IfwN8AmPCyZtVGNR0h0hGn8hnWBAFztqjM2eJkRV8F8Qz8ua#content-signals). |
| ID Provenance Guidance applicable for all inventory | We rely on accurate signaling of how user IDs are created, inserted, and matched throughout the supply chain. To ensure trust and proper interpretation of identity, SSPs and publishers must preserve ID provenance, correctly identify the inserter and matcher, and accurately pass forward the mm (match method) value associated with each Extended Identifier(EID).<br/> **Key requirements:**<ul><li>**Preserve ID provenance:** always pass forward the original mm value from the incoming EID. If a publisher or SSP receives an ID with mm=3, 4, or 5, you must retain and propagate that same mm value, even if your own internal match used mm=1 or mm=2</li><li>**Signal the correct matcher:** the matcher is the party that created the linkage (publisher, SSP, device graph, etc.). The resulting mm value must reflect their match method, not the method the SSP uses to look up a DSP-specific ID (e.g., cookie sync)</li><li>Follow expected ID derivation:<ul><li>**buyeruid:** must come from a real-time cookie sync</li><li>**device.ifa:** must come from the OS-level advertising ID.</li><li>Any alternative derivation must be disclosed through the mm value.</li></ul></li><li>**Use atype & mm together appropriately:** atype describes what kind of ID is in the bidstream (browser/device, in-app, or person-based), while mm describes how the linkage was formed. These must be consistent with one another and with the provenance of the incoming ID.</li></ul><br/>**NOTE:** Be sure to send ID provenance according to IAB guidance which is aligned to TTD guidelines here. |




## Inventory Efficiency

| Guideline | Details |
|---|---|
| Single source of inventory |Only one source of inventory for a particular media type per seller is allowed. Therefore do not send one media type inventory via multiple integration types or header bidding solutions like (Google) Open Bidding (OB), (Amazon) Transparent Ad Marketplace (TAM), Prebid, etc. Choose one out of them that suits your purpose. However, it is allowed to send one media type via one solution and other media types via different solutions. For example, a selling publisher, Publisher-Company123, cannot send display inventory via Exchange-ABC, on two different seller IDs. Publisher-123 can send video inventory through Exchange-ABC on `seller_id=1` and display on the same exchange via `seller_id=2`. If the publisher prefers, sellers 1 and 2 can represent different header solutions.|
| OMSDK Adoption | Applicable for in-app inventory, especially CTV<br/> We’re asking all CTV inventory providers to adopt the IAB Tech Lab’s Open Measurement SDK (OM SDK) for their CTV apps to enable standardized, transparent, and verifiable ad measurement across platforms. Implementation guidance can be found here:<br/> **Benefits of Adopting OM SDK:** <br/><ul><li>**Standardized Measurement Across CTV:** OM SDK ensures consistent measurement of ad impressions, viewability, and engagement signals, eliminating discrepancies across platforms and partners.</li><li>**Independent Verification & Fraud Protection**:** Enables third-party verification of ad delivery, invalid traffic, and brand safety, helping protect advertiser spend and publisher reputation.</li><li>**Privacy-Safe & Secure:** OM SDK does not handle user identifiers or audience data, preserving user privacy and securing publisher audience segments.</li><li>**Device Authenticity Assurance:** Through Device Attestation, OM SDK helps verify that impressions are rendered on authentic devices, reducing spoofing and fraud risk.</li></ul> |


## Inventory Quality


| Guideline | Details |
|---|---|
| CTV quality content | To transact CTV inventory on The Trade Desk platform, be sure to meet the following policies and requirements:<ul><li>The Trade Desk prohibits resold CTV. To ensure the direct traffic continues to transact, any CTV sellers that are sending both direct and resold CTV with the same seller ID must separate the direct and resold supply into separate seller IDs.</li><li>There may be more than one entity with direct sales rights to CTV supply (carriage rights agreements). If the inventory is exclusive to the seller, and payment terminates with the seller, this is allowed. In this case, use the Inventory Partner Domain. For more details, see [IAB Tech Lab Guidance for Inventory Sharing](https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CTV_app-ads_IABTechLab_Explainer_Guide_Public_Comment_2020-12.pdf).</li><li>CTV inventory excludes devices that are placed in public environments and devices that are expected to be muted by default.</li><li>The Trade Desk prohibits resold CTV. To ensure the direct traffic continues to transact, **any CTV sellers that are sending both direct and resold CTV with the same seller ID must separate the direct and resold supply into separate seller IDs.**</li></ul>|

## TTD/Monetize Integration Specifics

| Guideline | Details |
|---|---|
| Supported ad formats |The TTD/Monetize integration supports Banner, Video, CTV, and Native across both Web & App.<br/><br/>Note: Audio and DOOH are not supported.|
