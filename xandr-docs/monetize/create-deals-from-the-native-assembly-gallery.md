# Create deals from the Native assembly gallery

## Overview

You can now create deals directly from Native assembly gallery, streamlining the workflow between native inventory configuration and deal creation. This capability reduces setup time by prepopulating key deal fields and automatically associating relevant inventory, while still allowing full flexibility to make changes as needed. This workflow enables you to:
- Create a deal using one or more Native Assembly renderers
- Automatically associate relevant placements and configurations
- Start with a preformatted deal name that aligns with library taxonomy requirements
- Accelerate deal setup while retaining full control over final configurations


## Create a deal from Native assembly gallery

1. Navigate to **Native Assembly Gallery**.
1. Select one or more renderers.
1. Under **Actions**, select **Create Deal**.
1. Select the **Advertiser** and **Insertion Order (IO)**, as you would when creating any deal.
1. Review the deal configuration and make updates as needed.
1. To simplify deal creation, several fields and configurations are automatically prepopulated when you create a deal from Native Assembly gallery. This approach ensures faster setup while preserving flexibility, allowing you to tailor the deal to your specific requirements. Key prepopulated fields include:
    - **Deal name:** A deal name is prefilled using the standard taxonomy required for library deals.
    - **Inventory and placements:** All placements associated with the selected Native Assembly renderers are automatically selected.
    - **Default configurations:** Certain deal settings are preselected to reduce manual setup.

> [!NOTE]
> The prepopulated deal name, inventory controls, placements, targeting selections, and certain deal settings are preselected to reduce manual setup, but is fully editable and can be modified before saving the deal.
