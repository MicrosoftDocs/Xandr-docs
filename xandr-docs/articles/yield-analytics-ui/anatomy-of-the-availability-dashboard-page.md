# Anatomy of the availability dashboard page

The Availability Dashboard page is the primary view for the **Availability** tab. This provides a summary of available revenue, available sell-through, and how available inventory is trending. It is displayed automatically when you click the **Availability** tab.

## About the availability dashboard interface

The Availability Dashboard page is comprised of the following three widgets:

- **Available Revenue** – Displays available revenue (calculated as Impressions × Rate Card) for the top-performing products in a given product group for a given time period (next three months by default). You can change the product group and the time period in this widget.
- **Utilization/Sell-Through** – Displays sell-through rate for the top-performing products in a given product group, for a given time period (next three months by default). You can change the product group and time period in this widget.
- **Availability Trended** – Displays impressions capacity, divided between guaranteed and preemptible impressions, across the network or for a selected product for a given time period (previous three months and next three months by default). You can change the product and time period in this widget. You can also filter the graph to show only guaranteed impressions or only preemptible impressions.

To the left of the widgets is the **Availability Tasks** panel. This is where you can select between three options to check for available inventory:

- **Check Availability** – Takes you to the **Availability Lookup** page. This is where you can search for available inventory by product and/or across products by one or more attributes. You can also create batch lookups from this page to search availability across multiple sets of product criteria.
- **View Calendar** – Takes you to the **View Calendar** page. This is where you can view daily availability for a given month to find openings for new deals. This is especially useful for sponsorships.
- **View Batch Lookups** – Takes you to the **Batch Lookups** page. This is where you can check the status of your availability batch lookups and review completed availability batch lookups (also referred to as "availability reports"). You can export batch lookups to Excel worksheet (XLS) or comma-separated values (CSV) files.

Below the Availability Tasks panel is the Processing Summary panel. This is a read-only panel that indicates when the availability forecast and order data were last updated.
