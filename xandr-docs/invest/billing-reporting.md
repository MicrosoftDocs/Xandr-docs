# Microsoft Invest - Billing Reporting

This section of the Reporting Guide provides descriptions of the metrics and dimensions you can include, as well as the filters you can apply to several billing-specific reports (e.g., ad serving fees, FX margin fees, creative audit fees, media cost, revenue, etc.).

> If you have signed a new contract with Microsoft Advertising and completed the cutover, FX margin and Foreign exchange fees will no longer be applicable.
