# Managing Your Inventory Reselling Exposure



As a seller, you may want to allow other platform members to target some
of your managed inventory. Our system makes a distinction between making
inventory targetable and making it buyable by other members. This page
describes how to expose your inventory for resale to other members.

You can control which other platform members can target your inventory.
See <a

class="xref">Edit Buyer Eligibility, Allowed Payment Types, and
Targeting Access</a> for more information.

Expose Your Inventory to Third-Party Buyers

If you have inventory you'd like to resell to buyers on the platform,
you'll probably want to be able to pick and choose which inventory you
make available for targeting by other members' campaigns. The
Reselling Exposure screen allows
you to do just that.

**Targetable vs. Buyable Inventory**: Exposing your inventory makes it
targetable. Enabling individual placements for resale makes them
buyable. For more information about this distinction, see
<a href="reselling-managed-inventory.md" class="xref">Reselling
Managed Inventory</a>.

Getting There

To get to the Reselling Exposure
screen, select
Network 
\>  Tools  \>
 General from the top
navigation menu. The Reselling
Exposure tab will be displayed by default.

Reselling Priority

For each impression on a managed publisher, if there is a campaign from
a managed advertiser with a priority at or above this number, do not
resell the impression to an external buyer. This lets you create a
priority "waterfall" where your own advertisers' campaigns are given
preference over campaigns run by external buyers.



<b>Note:</b> You can ignore this setting if
you don't have both managed supply and demand.



Publisher Reselling Exposure

In this section, you can expose one or more of your publishers'
inventory for targeting by other platform members' campaigns.

- In the **Private Publishers** box, click
  Add next to each publisher you want
  to expose. This will move that publisher to the
  Exposed Publishers box, making it
  visible for targeting by other platform members.
- To return a publisher to private exposure, click
  Remove next to the publisher's name
  in the Exposed Publishers box.
