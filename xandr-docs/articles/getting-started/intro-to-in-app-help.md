# Introduction to Xandr In-App Help 

In some of our products, you can get help without leaving the application. Do you have a question about a field you need to fill in? Do you need more information on a particular topic or feature? Simply open up the help and read about it without ever leaving the page you're on. Here's how it works.

Hover over the question mark in the top navigation bar and click **Open Documentation**.

![Open Documentation](../media/intro-to-in-app-help/open-help.png)



This opens a pop-up window that shows a list of topics related to where you are within the product. For example, in the image below we're on the **Create a New Line Item** screen, and the window is showing the topics "Create an Augmented Line Item," "Working with Line Items," and "Augmented Line Items \(ALI\)."

Select a topic, then hover over the window to see options for viewing and navigating through the information.

There are three different window sizes: the smaller Default view, a slightly wider Theater mode, and Full screen. You can also click **Open in new tab** to open the topic here in the Documentation Center, where you can view it in the context of the full documentation set for the product you're working in.

Use the search box to find help on anything within the product you're currently logged into. For example, if you're in Invest DSP, the search will be limited to Invest documentation. As you begin to type, you'll be presented with suggested topics. Or press **Enter** to see a full set of matching search results.

If the window is hiding parts of the screen you can always close it, or simply drag it out of the way.
