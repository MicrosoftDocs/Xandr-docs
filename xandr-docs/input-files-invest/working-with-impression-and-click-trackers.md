# Working with Impression and Click Trackers



Impression and click trackers are used to track impressions and clicks
associated with creatives that are hosted by off-platform
(non-Xandr) ad servers. This is done by
attaching the tracker as a "piggyback pixel" on the externally hosted
creative. This lets you report on impressions and clicks on these
creatives as if they were hosted by Xandr.

There are several reasons why you might want to use an impression or
click tracker. For example:

- Some publishers' ad servers may not allow you to run
  Xandr placement tags.
- You may be running a non-banner ad campaign, but you want to track the
  data from that campaign in Xandr.

For more information about how to set up impression and click trackers
and report on them, see the documentation linked below.
