# Seat screen

The Seat screen is where a bidder can see the buyer seats registered under their bidder. The Buyer Seats allow for external bidders to bid with their custom buyer IDs rather than using Xandr member IDs. For additional details on the seat, bidders can use the [Seat Service](seat-service.md).

## Deal screen access

1. Sign in to the [Bidders UI](https://bidder.xandr.com/).
1. Select the bidder.
1. Click **Switch to Default User**. The **Profiles** screen is accessed.
1. Click on the **Seats** tab to access the **Seats** screen. (It is located to the right of the **Profiles** tab).

## Seat screen table

The seat screen lists all of the seats for a bidder, and their associated attributes/metadata. The table below details each of the columns displayed:

| Column Name | Filterable | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Buyer Seat ID | Yes | The bidder's seat ID native to their own systems. |
| Buyer Seat Name | Yes | The name of the buyer associated to the seat. Note that auto-registered seats will be automatically labelled in the format of *bidder_name (buyer seat ID)*. |
| Creation Date | No | Date the seat was created in Xandr systems. |
| Last Modified | No | Date the seat was last modified in Xandr systems. |
