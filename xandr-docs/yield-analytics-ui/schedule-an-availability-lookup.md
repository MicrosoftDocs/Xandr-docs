# Schedule an availability lookup

When you email a report to yourself or designated recipients you can send it immediately or on a recurring schedule.

1. On the **Availability Lookup** page, create a new lookup and save it.
1. On the toolbar, select **Send**. The **Send a Lookup Report** dialog appears.
1. On the **Recurrence** dropdown list, select how frequently you want the lookup to be sent, or select **None** to send the lookup immediately without scheduling it.
1. In the **Send To** box, enter the email address for each recipient, separating each address with a comma. You can include up to 50 email addresses. To send a report to more than 50 addresses, use a distribution list.
1. (Optional) In the **Message** box, type any comments you want to include in the email.
1. (Optional) As needed, clear the checkboxes for items to be included in the email.
    - If you're sharing the lookup with someone who doesn't have access to Yield Analytics, the recipient can't receive a URL Link to access the report.
    - If you're sending the lookup as an attachment, it includes the lookup results as an attachment to the email.
1. Select **Send**.

The lookup results link will only display results while the forecast is still valid (i.e., has not expired).

To schedule a lookup to run bi-monthly, create two monthly instances of recurrence (e.g., one on the 1st and one on the 15th).

If you have administrative access, you can select **Admin Tools** > **View Saved Lookups** to view, edit, and delete scheduled lookups.
