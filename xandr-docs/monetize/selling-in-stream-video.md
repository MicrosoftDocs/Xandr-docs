To monetize video inventory, you need to successfully describe the player and its specifications using the placement object. These capabilities are fully supported by Monetize and the Microsoft Advertising API.

Some advantages of trafficking in-stream video placements via the Microsoft Advertising platform include:

- Microsoft Advertising will respond with a bid in under 150ms, reducing latency.

- The reach and scale of the Microsoft Advertising platform allows Microsoft Advertising video buyers to find their audience on your inventory. You can take advantage of Programmatic Deals, leverage first-party data, and initiate deals with buyers to generate increased CPM.

- Microsoft Advertising offers exclusive access to several large demand partners who leverage Microsoft Advertising as their only buying channel. Our integration with all major video DSPs provides the greatest available access to demand for Microsoft Advertising platform sellers.
