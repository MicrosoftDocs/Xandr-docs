- `ANAdProtocol landingPageLoadsInBackground`: Controls the SDK's behavior when an ad is clicked. The default behavior (`YES`) is to load the landing page in the background until the initial payload finishes loading and then present a fully rendered page to the user. Setting this to `NO` will cause the in-app browser to immediately become visible and display the unrendered landing page. Note that setting this to `NO` when an ad redirects to the app store may cause the in-app browser to briefly flash on the screen.
- `ANAdProtocol setLocationWithLatitude:longitude:timestamp:horizontalAccuracy:precision:`: Provide a precision parameter when passing a user's location from a `CoreLocation` instance that will cause all location information to be internally rounded to the specified number of digits after the decimal before being passed to the ad server. The nominal resolution of digits after the decimal to distance is 2 digits to ~1 km, 3 digits to ~100m, 4 digits to ~10m. If set to -1, then full resolution is passed.
- `ANBannerView (ANBannerViewAdAlignment) alignment`: Overrides the alignment of the ad unit within the banner view, in the event the banner view frame is larger than the ad. The default alignment is `ANBannerViewAdAlignmentCenter`. Set this property to align the ad to the top left, top center, top right, center left, center right, bottom left, bottom center or bottom right.

[ANAdAdapterBaseAmazon setAmazonAppKey: "YOUR APP KEY"];
```
