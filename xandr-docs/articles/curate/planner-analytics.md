# Planner Analytics



The Planner visualizations show a summary and visualization of your
projected deal line item performance for a plan
when you select it from the list of plans. You can see more detailed,
interactive projections when you create or edit a plan.



Planner's visualizations can guide your media plan and help you
understand the capability of specific deals. As
you try out different configurations in the left pane while you create
or edit a plan, you can update the analytics and visualizations to show
the projected results, so you can adjust your strategy before making a
final decision.

Note: Planner relies on data that is
collected over time for its forecasts. For the most accurate results,
audiences should be onboarded and deals should be live for a week before
you begin forecasting in Planner.



A user is a device ID, not an actual person: often a person has multiple
user IDs. If you've enabled cross-device, Planner returns estimates for
all the device IDs linked to a user. For impression estimates, we sample
auction logs and generate sketches that include dimensions (supply type,
ad type, inventory URL, and so on) specific to the auction. For user
estimates, we sample users and include geo region, segments, and other
data. We also find all associated auctions and related dimensions, and
use all this data to generate sketches.





## Summary View



When you select a completed plan from the list in the main
Planning screen, you can see
non-interactive overview information about targeting and supply in the
right pane.

## Create/Edit View

When you create or edit a plan, you have access to detailed interactive
visualizations that analyze the factors in your projected line item
performance and recommend inventory based on your settings. Changing the
settings in the left pane lets you estimate the impact of your
adjustments to budget, targeting, and other line item criteria.
