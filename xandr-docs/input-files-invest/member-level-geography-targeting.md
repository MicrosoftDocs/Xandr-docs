# Member-Level Geography Targeting



When you apply member-level targeting, the settings will be applied
globally to all line items for all advertisers under the member.

**Geography Targeting** allows you to create of a list of countries from
which your campaigns will be able to purchase impressions through open
exchange. Defining this list allows you to be more efficient when
setting up your line items because you will have a smaller set of
countries from which to select for your **Geography** setting.



<b>Note:</b> These settings apply only to
inventory bought through open exchange. They have no impact on managed
inventory.



Getting Started

Geography settings are available from the
Member Settings screen (hover over
your member name in the upper-right corner of the menu bar and click
Member Settings).

From the Member Settings screen you
can view any settings that have already been applied.

To add or modify the settings, click the edit icon (the pencil) next to
**Geography Targeting** to open the **Edit Geography Targeting** window.

Add or Modify Geography Settings

To add a country:

1.  From the **Edit Geography Targeting** window, type the name of the
    country you want to add. As you type, countries matching the entered
    text appear.

2.  Select the country you want to add. The country will appear in the
    **Selected** list below the search box.

3.  Click Save.

    To remove a country:

4.  From the **Edit Geography Targeting** window, click the X to the
    right of any country in the **Selected** list you want to remove.
