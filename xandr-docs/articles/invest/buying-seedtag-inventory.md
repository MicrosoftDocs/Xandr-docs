There are several steps you need to take to get started.

## Set up seedtag as an eligible partner

Before you can sell through Seedtag you need to set them up as an eligible partner. For instructions on setting up a relationship with
Seedtag, see [Managing Relationships with Sellers](./managing-relationships-with-sellers.md).

## Send your creative to seedtag

Seedtag's in-image format is a non-IAB Standard ad format which requires them to adapt your creative and provide you with the ad tag to be
implemented. You must send your creative (preferably as a PSD file) to [programmatic@seedtag.com](mailto:programmatic@seedtag.com) to receive a tag that you will apply when adding your creative in Microsoft Invest.

## Request the creation of a deal ID to seedtag

Contact Seedtag at [programmatic@seedtag.com](mailto:programmatic@seedtag.com) to request a deal ID.
Please specify your buyer ID and the type of audience you're looking
for.

## Set up your line item

Your line item must be set up according to the guidelines here.

**Buying strategy:**  
You must select CPM as your **Buying Strategy**. You can select any option under **Pay on a Per-impression (CPM) basis**, but you cannot use any other basis (such as CPC or CPA).

**Inventory quality:**

- Select **Serve only on** Xandr-reviewed inventory.
- Select **Also serve on trusted seller-reviewed/unreviewed inventory**.

## Upload a third-party creative

Navigate to the **Creative Manager** screen. Click on the **Create New** button and select your creative type from the menu. In the **New Creative** dialog box select the following values:

- Type: **Third-party creative**
- Creative Format: **Third-party tag**
- Tag Type: **This tag is HTML**. Uncheck the **Serve in iFrame** option.
- Media Type: **Banner: Standard Banner**
- Template: **Xandr: Standard**
- Size: Select **New** from the dropdown list. Enter a **width** of **600** and a **height** of **105**
- Name: Self-classify the creative with the accurate brand.
  <br> In the Tag field, paste in the tag you received from Seedtag when you sent your creative. You will need to edit the tag. Your tag will contain a section like this:

  ``` pre
  /** PUT THE FINAL URL BETWEEN QUOTES **/ var targetUrl = "https://LandingPageUrl.com"; /** /PUT THE FINAL URL BETWEEN QUOTES **/ 
  ```

  Replace the `targetURL` value with your URL:

  ``` pre
  /** PUT THE FINAL URL BETWEEN QUOTES **/ var targetUrl = "https://YourCampignUrl.com"; /** /PUT THE FINAL URL BETWEEN QUOTES **/ 
  ```

  If you want to use an external click command, put that command in place of your URL.
