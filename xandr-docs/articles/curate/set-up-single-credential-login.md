# Set Up Single Credential Login



This will guide you through the single credential login set up process.





<b>Note:</b>

With consolidation of Xandr to Microsoft family, we have integrated the
authentication process of the users (who are using Xandr products) to
the Microsoft Identity Platform. The profound advantage of this
integration is that users would be able use to access Xandr applications
using the same sign-on methods to access other Microsoft products.
Additionally, the integration to the Microsoft Identity Platform enables
new and more secure methods of authentication, powered by Microsoft.

As soon as a single credential login has been created for you, you will
receive a welcome email with a link for setting your password. You need
to use the link and follow below steps to complete your login set-up.



This task explains how to set up your single credential login.

1.  Click on the link shared in the welcome mail.
2.  Click Set your password.
3.  After clicking on the link, follow the on-screen prompts to set your
    password.
    >

    Consider these requirements for setting up your password:
    - Must be at least 8 characters in length
    - Contains at least 3 of the following 4 types of characters:
      - Lowercase letters (a-z)
      - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
      - Numbers (0-9)
      - Special characters (for example, !@#$%&\*)
      - No more than 2 identical characters in a row (for example, "aaa"
        not allowed)

    



If your password meets the above criteria, you will receive a
notification that says that your password has been created successfully.
You can use your login credentials to access your digital application
user accounts now. Post login, you can switch between your user accounts
