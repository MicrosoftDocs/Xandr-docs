# Get Deals from Seller Packages



As a buyer, the best way to find deals is to browse sellers' packages,
which are pre-made combinations of inventory and/or data that can be
immediately converted into deals or can be used as a jumping-off point
for custom deal negotiations. This page walks you through the process.

Step 1. Browse seller packages

On the Package
Marketplace screen
(Partners
\>  Package Marketplace),
browse through available packages from sellers. The following
details display for each package:

- **Package Name** - The seller's name for the package.
- **Seller Name** - The name of the seller offering the package.
- **Price** - The price, if any, associated with the package. This is
  the minimum amount you must bid in order to compete for the packaged
  contents.
- **Contents Tags** - The Context, Audience, and Sizes tags display when
  the package contains selected inventory, segments, and sizes
  respectively. Hover over the details icon (eye) on the Sizes tag to
  view a list of the sizes included in the package.
- **Description** - The seller's description of the inventory and/or
  data included in the package.

Use the filters on the left to hone in on offers that meet your needs:

- **Filter by Sellers** - Select specific sellers to view the packages
  they offer.
- **Search for a Package** - Search package names and descriptions using
  keywords.
- **Filter by Package** - Select package contents that meet your needs.

Step 2. Get deals

Once you've found packages that you are interested in, there are two
ways to get targetable deals. You can either instantly generate deals
from packages "off-the-shelf," or you can ask sellers to customize
packages to meet your needs.

Option 1. Generate deals "off-the-shelf"

Click Add to Cart next to each package
that you want to convert into a deal. Then click
Get Deals to instantly convert the
packages into deals between you and the seller and to receive deal IDs
that you can target.

Option 2. Request a custom deal

If you are interested in a package but would like to ask the seller to
make modifications, click Request a Custom
Deal, enter your message, and then click
Submit. Your message will be posted in
the seller's <a href="partnership-details-screen-buyer-view.md"
class="xref">Partnership Details Screen - Buyer View</a>. Continue to
use the Activity Stream to negotiate with the seller.

Step 3. Target deals

If you generated a deal from a package, your deal ID is displayed in the
Selected Packages section.

- For Augmented Line Items, target deals using line item deal targeting.
  For more information, see
  <a href="deal-targeting-ali.md" class="xref">Deal Targeting (ALI)</a>.
- For Standard Line Items, click Target
  now! to instantly create a new campaign targeting the deal or
  to add the deal to an existing campaign. For complete step-by-step
  instructions on setting up your campaign, see
  <a href="create-a-deal-campaign.md" class="xref">Create a Deal
  Campaign</a>.
