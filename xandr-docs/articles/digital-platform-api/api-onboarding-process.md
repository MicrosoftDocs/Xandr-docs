# API Onboarding Process



Customers who plan to integrate with Xandr APIs
need to complete the following steps in our API onboarding process.



<b>Note:</b> The Xandr
API endpoints are accessible only to current customers. If you're not
currently a Xandr customer but are interested in
becoming one, <a href="https://www.xandr.com/contact-us/" class="xref"
target="_blank">request a consultation</a>.



To know more about Xandr's APi go
to, <a href="reference.md"
class="xref" target="_blank">Reference</a> page.



## Get API Access

The first step you must take to begin using the
Xandr API is
to <a href="http://help.xandr.com" class="xref" target="_blank">contact the
support team</a> to gain access to the API endpoints. In order to be
granted API access, you must meet the following criteria:

- Be a current Xandr UI customer with
  a *current* user ID and member ID. (Support cannot create a new user
  to fulfill a request for API access.)
- Be a Network, Network Observer, Advertiser, or Publisher user. We
  cannot grant API access to Network Advertiser Manager or Network
  Publisher Manager users.
  (See <a href="user-service.md"
  class="xref" target="_blank">User Service</a> for more on user types.)

When you open your support ticket, use the title "Request for API
Access". In the body of the support ticket, include the following
information:

- the numeric ID of the *user* that requires API access
- the billing name and numeric ID of the *member* under which that user
  exists

The support team cannot grant access to clients who are not platform UI
or Invest users. If you are a customer with users who would like access
to the API, contact the Platform Integrations team for your business
unit.

After you've been granted access, you can use the following endpoints:

- Monetize UI: <a href="https://monetize.xandr.com" class="xref"
  target="_blank">https://monetize.xandr.com</a>
- Invest UI: <a href="https://invest.xandr.com" class="xref"
  target="_blank">https://invest.xandr.com</a>
- Digital Platform API: <a href="https://api.appnexus.com" class="xref"
  target="_blank">https://api.appnexus.com</a>





## Read the Documentation

The API documentation provides insight into the structure of the API and
will help you determine the best approach for integration as well as
provide details on typical use cases. Read through
the <a href="reference.md"
class="xref" target="_blank">Reference</a> to find information and
examples for the individual services that are available to you.



<b>Tip:</b> API Change Info

We will notify customers of API changes. You can sign up to receive
emails of API changes, as well as other Xandr
news. If you have a Xandr user account, you
should receive relevant communications automatically. 






## Complete the Self-Paced Training

We offer a pre-recorded training
webinar, <a href="https://vimeo.com/123017389/15bce65150" class="xref"
target="_blank">API Overview and Training</a>, targeted at anyone
interested in developing against our APIs. (Note, the training was
recorded several years ago, but the basic concepts still apply.) The
training covers the following topics:

- The reasons for using an API
- Best practices for integrating
- Definitions of breaking and non-breaking changes
- Throttling, filtering and sorting
- Data entity mapping/relationships
- JSON introduction
- API authorization
- Available tools

You can download a
<a href="attachments/166636901.pdf" class="xref"
target="_blank">PDF version</a> of the PowerPoint presentation used in
the Webinar.

You should also read the <a
href="api-best-practices.md"
class="xref" target="_blank">API Best Practices</a>. This document also
covers many of the basic concepts that will help get you started.
