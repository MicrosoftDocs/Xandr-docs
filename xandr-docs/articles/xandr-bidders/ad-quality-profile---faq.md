## How are ad quality profiles used?

Each seller on Xandr has a member-level ad quality profile. This ID will
not change and will be present on every single bid request for that
member as the member_ad_profile_id. Sellers will also have an
impression-level ad quality profile. This may or may not be present, and
can apply on a tag, site, publisher, or conditional basis (e.g. users
per geo, number of impressions seen per day per user, etc.) The ID of
the impression-level ad quality profile will come through in the bid
request as ad_profile_id. If a creative is blocked by either the
member-level ad profile id or the impression-level ad profile, the
creative cannot serve.

## What is an ad quality profile?

Ad quality profiles are used by publishers to determine which creatives
are allowed to serve on their inventory. Ad quality profiles can block
or allow creatives based on language, technical attribute, parent brand,
brand, brand category, and/or buying member. Ad quality profiles can
additionally block or allowlist individual creatives. Each ad quality
profile has a unique ID on the platform. The ad quality profile
incorporates all of the business rules. A creative can get blocked based
on any of the aspects that are controlled in the ad quality profile. A
seller can change on a given day the specifics of that ad quality
profile - so on day 1, ad quality profile 12345 may block brands A, B,
and C, and on day 2, it may only block brand B.
