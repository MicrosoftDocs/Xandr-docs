# Curator feed

The Log-Level Curator Feed provides data on the transacted impressions of your curated deals. The feed contains one row per transacted impression. This data can then be used by curators to develop powerful offline attribution models, dashboards, and custom reporting as well as other solutions.

The Xandr internal name for this feed is `curator_feed`.

## Sequence

The columns below are listed in the same order in which they appear in the log-level feed file (top to bottom here, left to right in the file).

## Recommended precisions / Lengths of data types

In the [Columns](#columns) table below, some values in the **Type** column contain a recommended precision or length in parentheses. For example, `string(100)` means "this string is probably (but not guaranteed to be) less than or equal to 100 characters in length".

For integers, the sizes are described in the [Integer Key](#integer-key) section.

For `numeric` (floating point) data types, we recommend being able to accept a precision of (18,6), meaning that we expect there to be a maximum total of 18 digits: 12 to the left of the decimal point, and 6 to the right.

For `string` data types, the recommended length of the field varies depending on the field. See the table below.

> [!WARNING]
> These are Recommendations, not Guarantees.
>
> The data *types* are meant to be accurate as documented. However, the recommended *precision* or *length* for a given data type should not be read as a guarantee. For example, a string or numeric column's value may exceed the suggested length or precision listed on this page.
>
> The recommendations are intended to help you build your system to ingest this data. You may need to do additional processing on the output of the Curator Feed to make it work with your particular integration.
