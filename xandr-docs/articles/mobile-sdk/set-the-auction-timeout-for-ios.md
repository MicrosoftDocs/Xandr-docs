# Set the auction timeout for iOS

The setAuctionTimeout property defines the time period, in milliseconds,
to wait for a bidder to respond to a bid request. If the bidder fails to
respond within the value set for time out period (for example, 500
milliseconds), the bid request would result in failure.Â
