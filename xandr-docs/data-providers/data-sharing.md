# Data sharing

Data providers can expose their segments to data buyers by participating in the Xandr Data Provider program (contact your Xandr representative for more information) or using the Member Data Sharing Service for real-time data providers (if you have a bidder) or the Member Data Sharing Service for audience data providers (if you do not have a bidder or real-time integration).

> [!NOTE]
> Xandr does not permit clients to share segments with third parties until the data provider has signed our data access agreement. Clients may share first-party data if they have multiple member IDs under the same company on our platform. Please contact your Xandr representative if interested in signing the data access agreement.
