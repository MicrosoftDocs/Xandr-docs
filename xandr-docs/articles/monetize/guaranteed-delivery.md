This page describes features of Guaranteed Delivery line items and how they work at a high level.

For direct-sold business, where sales has secured an insertion order from a buyer with a committed impression volume, the most important performance indicator is that the line item delivers its budget in full and evenly across its flight dates. We call this type a **Guaranteed Delivery** (or "guaranteed") line item, and it has the following properties:

- Delivers budget in full across its flight dates
- Delivers budget evenly across its flight dates
- Delivers on guaranteed goals while still (optionally) competing in the auction with other demand such as RTB.

For instructions on creating a guaranteed line item, see [Create a Guaranteed Delivery Line Item](create-a-guaranteed-delivery-line-item.md).

For more information about using multiple campaigns with a guaranteed line item, see [Using Multiple Campaigns with a Guaranteed Line Item](using-multiple-campaigns-with-a-guaranteed-line-item.md).

## Delivery types

Guaranteed Delivery line items have the following delivery types that determine how they will be prioritized in the auction:

- Impressions
- Exclusive

### Impressions

Guaranteed line items with the **Impressions** delivery type have impression-based goals, which they will attempt to meet while pacing evenly throughout the day (or daypart). They typically have priorities ranging from 11-17.

### Exclusive

Unlike **Impression** guaranteed line items, guaranteed line items with **Exclusive** delivery types have percentage-based goals and have the highest priorities possible, typically ranging from 18-20. They will attempt to serve the scheduled percentage of total impressions where their targeting matches and they are eligible to serve.
