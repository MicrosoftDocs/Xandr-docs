# Token-based API authentication

To increase the security of your interactions with the Digital Platform API, we've implemented a signed token-based authentication system. This system uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to help ensure your sessions are as secure as possible. Follow along with these instructions and you should be up-and-running with JWT in no time.

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality is currently available to all users of the Digital Platform API. While JWT token-based authentication provides added security, at this time its use is encouraged but not mandatory. See [Authentication Service](./authentication-service.md) for more information on authentication processes.

## What is JWT?

From the [JWT website](https://jwt.io/introduction/):

"JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object."

Xandr provides REST API services to allow you to communicate with our system through command-line queries and JSON files, and returns responses in the form of JSON. Implementing a standard that allows you to securely transmit this information provides greater protection of your data and Xandr's entire system.

In addition, tokens enable better management of user logins. When your password expires you need to immediately switch over to a new password. With tokens, you can have multiple tokens at once, so when a token is nearing expiration you'll have a transition period that gives you time to update your login information.

## JWT library

In order to use JWT tokens, you'll need to have a token generator. You can generate JWT tokens by utilizing one of the many libraries available on the [JWT website](https://jwt.io/).

## Preparing to use tokens

Before you can use tokens, you'll need to log in using your password to gather some information and get your tokens set up in Xandr's system. Once your JWT token is registered you won't need to login with a password again.

Start by authenticating and retrieving an initial login token:

```
curl -X POST -d '{"auth":{"username":"<username>","password":"<PWD>"}}' https://api.appnexus.com/auth
```

The username and password are your standard login credentials.

Included in the response from this call will be a token, which will look similar to this:

```
"token": "hbapi:123456:9999aa0000dd9:nym2",
```

You'll use this token to access the system until you've registered your public key (which we'll create in just a moment).

Next you need to retrieve your user ID. Retrieve your user ID by calling the [User Service](./user-service.md):

```
curl -H 'Authorization: hbapi:123456:9999aa0000dd9:nym2' 'https://api.appnexus.com/user?username=<username>'
```

As the currently logged on user, you can also use this command to find your ID:

```
curl -H 'Authorization: hbapi:123456:9999aa0000dd9:nym2' 'https://api.appnexus.com/user?current'
```

Make note of the ID that's returned, you'll use this later in a JSON file to set up your token.

## Create private and public keys

> [!NOTE]
> **Information**
>
> Network Admin is the platform role required to create a public key for a given account.

Your private key is used to sign your authentication requests. A private key is meant to be exactly that: private. You don't want to share this key with anyone. Run this command to create your private key:

```
openssl genrsa -out my-api-key 2048
```

- [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/openssl.html): This is the command tool that will create a file containing your private key. It implements the Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security protocols.
- [genrsa](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/genrsa.html): The command that tells openssl to generate a private key. This uses the RSA cryptosystem.
- `-out my-api-key`: Put the private key into the file named `my-api-key`.
- `2048`: The size, in bits, of the private key. If you leave off this number the default is `512`. We recommend a value of `2048`.

The `my-api-key` file will replace your password as the secret that protects your API account.

Use your private key to generate a public key:

```
openssl rsa -in my-api-key -pubout > my-api-key.pub
```

- [rsa](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/rsa.html): The command that processes RSA keys.
- `-in my-api-key`: The file containing the private key to be used as input to create the public key.
- `-pubout`: This option specifies that a public key is to be output rather than a private key.
-  \> `my-api-key.pub`: The file that will hold your public key.

Your public key will be shared with the API and is used to verify that your private key was used to sign the JWT.

## Replace newline characters

Your public key contains line breaks. Because this key will be sent to the API as part of a JSON payload, you need to replace the line breaks with newline characters: \n. You can either do this by hand and then copy the key into your JSON file, or you can run the following command and copy the output:

```
perl -pe 's/n\n/\\n/g' my-api-key.pub
```

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on your command-line environment, this may just display the key with line breaks rather than the \n character. If that happens, you'll need to manually enter a \n to replace every line break when you copy the key to your JSON file.

## Create your public key JSON file

Create a JSON file like the following:

```
{
  "public-key": {
    "active": true,
    "name": "my-api-key",
    "user_id": <userid>,
    "encoded_value": "<public key>"
  }
}
```

Replace `<userid>` with the user ID we retrieved earlier.

For `<public key>`, paste in the full value of the public key, including the `BEGIN PUBLIC KEY` and `END PUBLIC KEY` text. Remember to replace all line breaks with \n. For example:

```
"encoded_value": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIIBI....\n......\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"
```

Save the JSON file. For this example, we've named the file `my-public-key.json`.

## Register your public key

Run the following command to register your public key:

```
curl -H 'Authorization: hbapi:123456:9999aa0000dd9:nym2' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST -d @my-public-key.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/public-key?user_id=<userid>'
```

Notice that we used the same token in our call to the public-key service that we used in our earlier call to the user service.

If your key was successfully registered, you'll receive a response similar to this:

```
{
    "response": {
        "status": "OK",
        "count": 1,
        "start": 0,
        "num_elements": 1,
        "debug_info": {
            "instance": "01.authentication-api.test1.nym2",
            "time": 475,
            "start_time": "2017-02-07T16:48:42.747Z",
            "version": "0.22.0",
            "request_id": "01.authentication-api.test1.nym2-1486486122747-0000000000000000000"
        },
        "public-key": {
            "active": true,
            "encoded_value": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIIBI...\n...\n...\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----",
            "name": "my-api-key",
            "user_id": 1234
        }
    }
    }
```

## Create a JWT signature

### JWT generator pseudoCode examples

The examples below assume that the user has set certain variables to information specific to the key being used to authenticate with. For example, the `an_key_name` variable used for the `kid` header in the code below would hold the value of the `"name"` field used in the JSON object during registration of the public key with Xandr (see
[Register Your Public Key](#register-your-public-key) above). The `username` variable used for the `sub` header value would map to the username associated with the key, etc.

### Python example

```
# Generates the JWT signature, using the PyJWT library
with open(priv_key_path, 'r') as f:
            cert = f.read()
jwt_signature = jwt.encode({
                'sub': username, 
                'iat': datetime.datetime.utcnow()
            }, 
            cert, 
            algorithm='RS256', 
            headers={
                'kid': an_key_name, 
                'alg': 'RS256', 
                "typ":"JWT"
            }
        )
```

### NodeJS example

```
var jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
var token = jwt.sign({ sub: username, iat: epoch_time }, cert, { algorithm: 'RS256', header: { kid: an_key_name, alg: 'RS256' }}); 
```

## Authenticate with a JWT

It's now time to authenticate using our private key and your JWT generation script. Run a command similar to this to create your JWT and authenticate:

```
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -d $(./<JWT generator>) https://api.appnexus.com/v2/auth/jwt
```

"JWT generator" is the script you created with a JWT library that generates the token. There are pseudocode example above of what may be in this JWT Generator. You can run your script separately and simply pass in the token itself to this command.

This will return a response containing your new token:

```
{
        "response": {
                "status": "OK",
                "token": "authn:184994:a1111111-6766-3b66-8544-f11111111ffd:lax1",
                "debug_info": {
                        "instance": "01.authentication-api.test1.lax1",
                        "time": 624,
                        "start_time": "2017-02-07T16:49:52.612Z",
                        "version": "0.22.0",
                        "request_id": "01.authentication-api.test102975.lax1-1486486192612-3065414328498075565"
                }
        }
        }
```

## Use your token

You can now use the token returned from your JWT call to authenticate all calls into the API. For example, here's that same call to the user API service using our new token:

```
curl -H 'Authorization: authn:184994:a1111111-6766-3b66-8546-f11111111ffd:lax1' 'https://api.appnexus.com/user?current'
```

## New session

After your session has expired, you'll need to authenticate again. But from this point on you can skip all the steps in the previous section up to Create a JWT Token. That means that for each session, you'll need to create a new JWT token and use that token to authenticate the rest of your API calls. You won't need to use your password again.

## Deactivate your public key

You can remove API access by deactivating the `public-key`. To deactivate a key, create a JSON file like this:

```
{
        "public-key": {
        "active": false
    }
}
```

As you can see, this file simply sets the `active` field to `false`, which indicates that the `public-key` is no longer `active`. Run the following command to deactivate the `public-key`:

```
curl -X PUT -H 'Authorization: authn:184994:a1111111-6766-3b66-8546-f11111111ffd:lax1' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @pkdeactivate.json 'https://api.appnexus.com/public-key?key_id=2&user_id=1234'
```

In the command, you must include the JSON with the `active` field set to `false` (in this case we've included that JSON in the file `pkdeactivate.json`). You must also include the `key_id` and the `user_id` in the query string (`public-key?key_id=2&user_id=1234`).

You can find the `key_ids` for a user with a simple `GET` command:

```
curl -H 'Authorization: authn:184994:a1111111-6766-3b66-8546-f11111111ffd:lax1' 'https://api.appnexus.com/public-key?user_id=1234'
```

You can easily reactivate the key with the same command we used to deactivate it. Simply change the JSON to set `active` to `true`.
