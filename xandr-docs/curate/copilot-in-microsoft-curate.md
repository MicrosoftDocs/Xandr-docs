Copilot in Microsoft Curate provides real-time, contextual assistance, helping you to navigate the platform efficiently. Built on a Large Language Model (LLM), Copilot enhances the experience by leveraging comprehensive help documentation from Microsoft Learn as its primary knowledge base. This provides insights into editing or creating objects, best practices, and product functionality. 

Copilot also integrates information from various platform components, including APIs, data processing modules, system configurations, and third-party integrations. This allows you to gain a deeper understanding of the entire platform by understanding both visible UI elements and underlying back-end functionalities that are not directly accessible through the interface. Integrating Copilot into the Microsoft Curate enables delivering up-to-date, reliable assistance that reduces dependency on traditional help methods and improves overall productivity.
