# Edit Buyer Eligibility, Allowed Payment Types, and Targeting Access



You can set the eligibility, allowed payment types, and targeting access
for buyers within the Partner Center
screen or in the Partner Controls tab.
The Partner Controls tab is also
visible to the buyer. They can see what you have exposed to and hidden
from them. Your default settings will apply if you do not set custom
settings for the buyer.



<b>Note:</b> While you can manage these
settings in the **Partner Center** and in the
Partner Controls tab, you can only
view the buyer's current settings in the
Partner Controls tab.





<b>Tip:</b> For more information about the
settings described on this page, see <a
