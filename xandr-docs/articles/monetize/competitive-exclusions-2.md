# Competitive Exclusions



You can use competitive exclusions to prevent creatives with competitive
brands or offer categories from serving alongside each other.

Competitive exclusion settings are available at the advertiser and
creative levels. If you set competitive exclusions at the advertiser
level, creatives associated with the brands or offer categories that you
select will not serve alongside that advertiser's creatives. If you edit
the competitive exclusion settings for an individual creative, the
brands or offer categories you select will not serve alongside that
specific creative. For more information, see
