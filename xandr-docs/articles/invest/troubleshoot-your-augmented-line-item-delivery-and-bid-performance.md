# Troubleshoot Your Augmented Line Item Delivery and Bid Performance



You can improve your augmented line item (ALI) delivery and impression
count, which in return will help you win more bids, by accessing the
Troubleshooting tab and reviewing
all top issues and bid performance messages.



1.  Navigate to the
    <a href="view-line-item-details.md#ID-000010c9__p_ttr_315_2mb"
    class="xref">Line Item Details</a>
    pane.
2.  Click the
    Troubleshooting tab.
    

    A prioritized list of top issues that are preventing your ALI from
    delivering may display in the Top
    Issues section. Top issues may include any of the following:
    - Unaudited creative
    - Inactive insertion order
    - Inactive line item

    
3.  To resolve these issues, click the pencil icon
    that displays next to each issue.
    

    You'll be automatically taken to the appropriate screen to make the
    necessary adjustments in most cases.

    
4.  Go to the Bid
    Performance section to gain insight into how your bids are
    performing.
    

    A list of bid performance messages may display in the
    Bid Performance section if
    your bid performance is underperforming. These messages will be
    prioritized within any one of these bid performance categories:
    member targeting, line item targeting, creative, bid value, and
    auction. For additional information, see

    title="You can access the Troubleshooting tab from the Line Item Details pane to obtain a prioritized list of top bid performance messages. These messages contain reasons and recommendations for improving your augmented line item&#39;s bid performance. Since these messages are prioritized by impact significance, you won&#39;t see every message referenced here at once when accessing the Troubleshooting tab.">Bid
    Performance Messages for Augmented Line Items</a>.

    

    

    If you arenâ€™t seeing any bid performance messages, ensure that the
    appropriate supply strategy is selected from the
    Supply Strategy menu. The
    Supply Strategy menu defaults to
    what was selected when setting up the ALI. If more than one supply
    strategy was selected, the default priority will be based on the
    order in which the supply strategies fall on the
    Create Line Item and
    Edit Line Item screens as
    follows:
    - Open Exchange
    - Managed
    - Deals

    
5.  Select a different supply strategy if the
    default is causing unexpected results.
    

    

    <b>Note:</b> If you're expecting bid
    performance messages but still don't see any, please contact your
    account manager.

    

    
6.  Click any one of the bid performance categories
    to gain insight into how your settings are affecting your bid
    performance.
    

    A yellow triangle will display if there are corresponding bid
    performance messages.

    
7.  Click the information icons that display next
    to the bid performance message to obtain additional information
    about what's happening (reason) and suggested recommendations for
    improving your bid performance.
8.  Click any one of buttons that display below to
    make the necessary adjustments if desired.
    

    You'll be automatically taken to the appropriate screen to make the
    necessary adjustments in most cases.
