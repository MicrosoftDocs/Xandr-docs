# Bidder Best Practices



As you integrate your bidder and get set to go live, there are a number
of wiki pages and bidder settings we recommend using to ensure that you
have the best experience possible on our platform. This page highlights
a number of services, bidder fields, and practices that are commonly
overlooked but prove very useful to our partners.

## Recommended

We recommend to set the `audit_notify_email` and `sherlock_notify_email`
fields in the <a
href="https://docs.xandr.com/bundle/xandr-bidders/page/member-service.html"
class="xref" target="_blank">Member Service</a>  to valid email
addresses. This will ensure you are notified when your creatives are
audited and will enable you to take action, where needed.





## Not Recommended

A practice that we do **not** typically recommend is setting your bidder
profile to run exclusively on a allowlist by domain.  While this is
possible, there is a very good chance you will be severely limiting the
traffic you are seeing mainly because publishers reserve the right to
mask domains or not provide any domain detail at all.  If you find there
is a publisher that is not providing the level of transparency you
desire, please contact your Xandr
representative.
