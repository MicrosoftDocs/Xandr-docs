# Deal Lists for Curated Deals





A deal is an agreement between a buyer, curator or seller that provides
special access to inventory and/or data. Deals are primarily used to
access preferred premium inventory, negotiated inventory or unique
audiences.

A deal list is a group of deals IDs categorized under a single heading
for targeting across curated deal line items. Deal lists allow curators
to pre-define lists of seller deals for their operations team and
streamline their workflows, making it easy to target the same group of
seller deals across curated deal line items. If deal grouping
requirements change, you can make the changes in the deal list and all
curated deal line items will be updated accordingly.





## Manage Deal Lists

You can create and manage Deal Lists at
the Member and Advertiser level. A deal list may
contain one or more deal IDs and a deal ID can be added to multiple deal
lists. However, a deal ID can be added only once to a single deal list.
While adding or removing deals in a deal list, you can find the deals by
deal id, deal name or deal alias. Additionally, deal IDs can be added to
a list in bulk.
