# Request ads over HTTPS on Android

> [!NOTE]
> This property is scheduled to be deprecated in a future release.

Starting with v2.15 of our SDKs, we support requesting ads over HTTPS. This is a global setting for the Mobile SDK. You only need to set this once, and all future ad requests will be sent over HTTPS.
