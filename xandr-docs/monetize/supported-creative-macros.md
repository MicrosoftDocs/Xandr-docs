## Content ID creative support

The **content_ID** creative macro enables content-level reporting for ads. This macro allows advertisers to track exactly where their ads are shown, instead of relying on bundle IDs.

When the creative includes the `content_ID` macro, it triggers a third-party (3P) tag embedded in the creative. This tag calls **Peer39**, which processes the macro data to generate reports. Advertisers can then view detailed reports showing the specific content where their ads were displayed.

### Data flow and reporting

The data flow works as follows:

- The `content_ID` macro in the creative triggers a **3P tag**.
- The tag communicates with **Peer39**, which processes the macro data for content-specific reporting.
- The macro data is used to generate content-level reports, allowing advertisers to view exactly where their ads ran.
This level of reporting provides more detailed insights than traditional bundle ID tracking, helping advertisers optimize their content-level targeting and campaign performance.

### Publisher and market targeting

The following publishers are targeted to send the content_ID signal for reporting:

- **DirecTV**
- **Philo**
- **Xumo**

**GroupM Nexus ATV** has tested the Peer39 pixel in the following regions:

**Canada**: 100% of campaigns use the Peer39 pixel for reporting.
**United States**: Approximately 30-40% of campaigns use the Peer39 pixel for reporting.

The next phase includes continuing tests in Canada and the US, with a gradual move toward applying the Peer39 pixel to all campaigns. Mexico has also expressed interest in using the Peer39 pixel for content-level targeting and reporting.

### Global expansion plans

Finecast (part of **GroupM Nexus ATV**) plans to assess the global need for the Peer39 pixel and standardize its usage across markets. Currently, GroupM operates in **20 markets** globally, with plans to expand into 11 new markets within the next 3-6 months, including the UK.

According to internal assessments, the use of the Peer39 pixel could contribute **$14** million in additional growth globally, supporting GroupM’s current growth trajectory and its programmatic buying strategy.

### Usage and impact updates

GroupM Nexus ATV plans to expand the usage of the Peer39 pixel and will continue to evaluate its impact throughout 2024. Users can expect updates on global market availability and adoption as the testing progresses.

## Privacy macros

In order for our clients to meet their transparency, notice, and choice/consent requirements under US state privacy law, the GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive, Microsoft Advertising supports the [Global Privacy Platform](https://iabtechlab.com/gpp) and the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework (the "Framework"). For more information, see [the IAB Europe Transparency &amp; Consent Framework](https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/). Publishers should reference [Part of Privacy Regulations](../policies-regulations/index.yml) when using macros, such as the ones noted in the table below, to surface notice, transparency, and choice to end users located in the EEA, signal approved vendors, and pass consent to Microsoft Advertising and demand sources as well as their vendors through the Microsoft Advertising Platform. For more information, see [Part of Service Policies](../policies-regulations/index.yml).

| Macro | Description |
|---|---|
| `${GDPR_APPLIES}` | Designates whether GDPR regulations are applied. It specifically indicates whether the user is located in a GDPR impacted country, or if we have a GDPR-required signal passed with the request. Possible values include:<br> - `0` for no<br> - `1` for yes<br>**Note**: `0` may be received from an EEA country. It is the publisher's choice to signal in this manner. |
| `${GDPR}` | This is an alias for `${GDPR_APPLIES}`, and behaves in the same manner. |
| `${GDPR_CONSENT_STRING}` | This macro specifies the IAB GDPR consent string. If the GDPR applies, it will contain a list of user-approved vendors based on the IAB GDPR Transparency and Consent Framework. For more information, see [IAB GDPR Transparency and Consent Framework](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework). |
| `${GDPR_CONSENT}` | This macro is an alias for `${GDPR_CONSENT_STRING}`, and behaves in the same manner. |
| `${GDPR_CONSENT_[0-9]+}` | For example, GDPR_CONSENT_1, GDPR_CONSENT_12345 etc. These all resolve to the same GDPR consent string as explained above in `'${GDPR_CONSENT_STRING}'`. |
| `${XANDR_DOMAIN}` | Dynamically retrieves the appropriate Microsoft Advertising domain based on the cookie consent settings included in the TCF string. If the user has cookies enabled from their browser settings but has:<br> - not given consent for their cookies to be included in the TCF string, the `adnxs-simple.com` domain will be used to prevent the browser from attaching cookies to subsequent ad calls.<br> - given consent for their cookies to be included in the TCF string, the `adnxs.com` domain will be used to pass cookies in the header of each ad call.<br>**Note**: This macro should only be used if you plan on serving impressions in countries that require consent for cookies. |
| `${GPP_SID}` | Designates whether a section (i.e. regulatory framework) of the [Global Privacy Platform](https://iabtechlab.com/gpp) should be applied. Specifically, it indicates whether the user is located in a country affected by legislation covered by the GPP. |
| `${GPP_STRING_XXXXX*}` | This is the IAB [Global Privacy Platform](https://iabtechlab.com/gpp) (GPP) string. If a section of the GPP applies, then this will contain framework-dependent information reflecting the consent elections of the user.<br>**Note**: * `XXXXX` can represent any numerical ID. |

## Function macros

A function macro performs a function on another macro. Function macros can be used in combination with any other creative macro, including custom macros. If they are not recognized at render time, they will not be translated and the function will not be called.

Microsoft Advertising currently supports the `{$URL_ENC}` function macro, which can be used for a variety of purposes related to encoding. A key use case is when a URL needs to be passed from ad server to ad server using a creative macro. Due to the presence of unsupported characters in standard URL formatting, the `{$URL_ENC}` function macro must be encoded at various stages of the process.

This function macro takes the following form:

```
${URL_ENC(${MACRO_NAME},#)}
```

`${MACRO_NAME}` is the macro to be encoded and `#` is the integer representing the number of times to encode the contents. Possible values include:

- `1`
- `2`
- `3`

Each encoding corresponds to a step in the redirect chain, as well as how a given third-party click tracker works with the macro. Double encoding will usually be needed for final destination URLs when a second ad server is involved, and triple encoding for a third ad server.

To determine whether you will need to use single, double, or triple encoding, you should check with your third-party click tracker and then test your `URL_ENC` macro to ensure it works. If your macro is not working, one consequence of this may be link breakage, which will result in users not reaching the intended destination URL.

| Encoding Example | Format |
|---|---|
| Encoding click URLs once | Use the following format:<br>`${URL_ENC(${CLICK_URL},1)}`<br><br>**Note**: If [https://xandr.com](https://xandr.com) is passed as the click URL, using `${URL_ENC(${CLICK_URL},1)}` to single encode the URL would result in `https%3A%2F%2Fxandr.com` populating the creative. |
| Encoding media URL once | Use the following format:<br> `${URL_ENC(${MEDIA_URL},1)}` |
| Encoding media URL twice | Use the following format:<br> `${URL_ENC(${MEDIA_URL},2)}` |
| Encoding a custom macro called ADFORMAT once | Use the following format:<br>`${URL_ENC(#{ADFORMAT},1)}` |

## Digital Services Act (DSA) macros

According to Article 26 of the DSA, online platforms, including Microsoft Advertising's publisher clients must provide clear, concise, and unambiguous information about advertisements by February 17th, 2024. These requirements include:

1. Clearly identifying that the information is an advertisement.
1. Disclosing the identity of an individual or legal person on whose behalf the advertisement is presented.
1. Indicating the identity of an individual or legal person who made payment for the advertisement, if different from the advertiser.
1. Providing information about the primary parameters used to determine the ad recipient and, where applicable, instructions on how to modify those parameters.

| Macro | Description |

| `${DSA_REQUIRED}` | Indicates if DSA information should be made available.<br>Possible values include:<br> - `0`: Not required.<br> - `1`: Required. Bid responses with or without DSA object will be accepted.<br>- `2`: Required. Bid responses without DSA object will not be accepted.<br>- `3`: Required. Bid responses without DSA object will not be accepted. Here, the publisher is an Online Platform. |
| `${DSA_BEHALF}` | The free UNICODE text string with a name on whose behalf the ad is being displayed. This macro is populated from the DSA bid response.<br>For example, `Advertiser`. |
| `${DSA_PAID}` | The free UNICODE text string of who paid for the ad. This macro is populated from the DSA bid response.<br>For example, `Advertiser`. |
| `${DSA_PARAMS}` | The combination of integer values representing user parameters, separated by an underscore “_”.<br>For example, `1_2_3`.<br>Possible values include:<br>- `1`: Information on your online activity indicating your similarity to groups targeted by the advertiser. For example, age group, gender, education level, or interests.<br>- `2`: Information on the setting in which you view a specific advertisement. For example, website content, device type, IP address, location (country or city).<br>- `3`: Information on your precise geographic location, with an accuracy of approximately 500 meters. |
