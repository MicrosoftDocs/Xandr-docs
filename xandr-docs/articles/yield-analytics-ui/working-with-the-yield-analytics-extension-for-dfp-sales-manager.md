# Working with the Yield Analytics Extension for DFP Sales Manager





## Background

You can access yield analytics derived forecast and contention
information directly in the DFP Sales Management interface using our
Chrome browser extension. This method of accessing our data is
particularly convenient for users who do not normally work in the yield
analytics user interface, but have a regular need to respond to proposal
requests and enter/update orders in the Sales Management product.





## Installation Instructions

Users who access Sales Manager using the Chrome browser are able to take
advantage of this functionality by following the installation and setup
instructions:

1.  Open the Chrome application.
2.  Navigate to the following link: <a
    href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yieldex-analytics-sales-m/ingnfjfbgglccomoildaalnppeifljlk"
    class="xref"
    target="_blank">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yieldex-analytics-sales-m/ingnfjfbgglccomoildaalnppeifljlk</a>
3.  Click Add to Chrome to install the
    plugin.
4.  On the dialog that appears, click Add
    extension to confirm the installation.
5.  View the yield analytics Sales Manager Extension in Chrome.
6.  Click on the Customize and control Google Chrome link in the menu
    bar (<b>Note:</b> This is the three vertical dots link)
7.  Select More Tools, and
    click Extensions.
    1.  Click on the Details link of the yield analytics Sales Manager
        Extension to view the configuration options.
    2.  If you intend to use the extension in incognito mode, you must
        enable the incognito control on the details page.
        1.  Click on the Extension options link to set up your account.
        2.  Enter the same Username and Password that are used for
            accessing the yield analytics user interface.
        3.  Enter the full Customer URL that is used for accessing your
            customer instance of the yield analytics user interface. 
            This should be entered without the https:// portion of the
            URL.
        4.  Once entered, login changes are saved automatically.
8.  After installing the Google Sales Manager Plugin, you will need to
    log out and back into Sales Manager in order to see the yield
    analytics capacity and availability results appear on the pages that
    are listed below.





## Update Instructions

The yield analytics Sales Manager Extension should update automatically
when a new version is pushed to the Chrome Web Store.  In the case where
you want the plugin to update on demand, the following steps can be
taken to manually control the process.

1.  View installed Chrome Extensions.
2.  Click on the Customize and control Google Chrome link in the menu
    bar (<b>Note:</b> This is the three vertical dots link).
    Select More Tools, and
    click Extensions.
    1.  Enable Developer Mode by clicking on the configuration option in
        the upper right-hand corner of the extension page.
    2.  A new series of options will appear on the Extension page
        including an UPDATE option.  Clicking this link will force all
        installed extensions to update to their latest versions.

If you are unable to force an update to your list of extensions you can
choose to remove the Yield Analytics Sales Manager Extension by clicking
on the Remove link on the extension and following the Installation
Instructions process.





## Where can you find Yield Analytics results?

After logging into your DFP account, navigate to
the Sales tab. Access any of the
following screens:

Catalog — The results are in the product name column, under each
product’s name, with a dedicated forecast request/refresh button. The
forecast is controlled by the date-range filter for this screen.

Proposal Detail — The results are in the proposal line item name column,
under each line item’s name, with a dedicated forecast request/refresh
button. All line items can be checked concurrently by utilizing the
request/refresh button in the column header. The forecast is controlled
by the date-range set up and targeting defined for each line item row in
this table.

Proposal Line-item Detail — The results are in a dedicated container
that appears between the product and line item name, with a yield
analytics Availability label. The forecast is controlled by targeting
and date-range information according to the most recent saved state. If
settings are changed, the line item must be saved prior to requesting a
new forecast. A dedicated Order Line Contention button is available to
understand which line items will be in competition with the one that you
have in focus, according to our proprietary understanding of inventory
consumption.
