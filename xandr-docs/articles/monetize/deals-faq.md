## **Deal FAQs for Sellers**





## How do I offer deals to buyers?

As a seller, you can use deals to provide buyers special access to your
inventory and/or data. For example, a deal might provide preferential
pricing on inventory, access to exclusive inventory, reduced competition
on inventory, or other opportunities.

There are two ways to offer deals to buyers:

- **Packages**: Packages are pre-made combinations of your inventory
  and/or data. Buyers can browse your packages and create deals from
  them "off-the-shelf", or they can use your packages as a jumping-off
  point for deal negotiations.
- **Deals**: In cases where your packages don't meet a buyer's needs,
  you can create a one-off custom deal for the buyer. For more details,
  see <a href="create-a-package.html" class="xref">Create a Package</a>
  and <a href="create-a-custom-deal.html" class="xref">Create a Custom
  Deal</a>.







## Where can I view and manage my packages and deals?

You can use the **Packages** screen to search your packages, view
details about specific packages, edit package settings, create new
packages, preview how your packages look to buyers, share your packages
with buyers, and more. For more details, see
<a href="manage-your-packages.html" class="xref">Manage Your
Packages</a>.

You can use the **Deals** screen to view deal details, monitor each
deal's health, trigger detailed reports, edit or cancel deals, and
create new deals. For more details, see
<a href="manage-your-deals-with-buyers.html" class="xref">Manage Your
Deals with Buyers</a>.





## What can I include in a package or deal?

You can select specific inventory, segments, sizes, or brands to include
in your deal. For more information, see
<a href="create-a-package.html" class="xref">Create a Package</a> and
<a href="create-a-custom-deal.html" class="xref">Create a Custom
Deal</a>.





## Can I create a guaranteed deal for a buyer?

No. Having a deal, even a private auction deal, does NOT guarantee that
the buyer will always win the deal inventory. As with RTB, there may be
other buyers competing for the deal inventory.





## Can I create a deal with external buyers?

Yes. For a list of supported external buyers and guidance on setting up
deals with them, see
<a href="negotiate-deals-with-buyers.html" class="xref">Negotiate Deals
with Buyers</a>.





## What is the difference between exposing a placement to a buyer and creating a deal for a placement?

Exposing a placement to the buyer allows the buyer to view the placement
when selecting campaign targeting and in reporting. If you create a deal
for a placement, the buyer can target the placement inventory by
targeting the deal, regardless of whether the placement is exposed or
hidden.





## When should I use a YM floor, and when should I use a deal price?

Use YM floors to define a minimum price for specific inventory. Use a
deal price to define a minimum price for a specific buyer.





## How do my YM floors interact with deal prices?

Deal prices take priority over floor prices. If you have a deal with no
ask price, that is considered a deal with no floor. Your existing YM
floor rules will apply to the deal inventory. If you have a deal with an
ask price of 0, that is considered a deal with a floor of 0. The deal
floor of 0 will take priority over any YM floors you have. For more
information on deal pricing and YM rules, see

Mechanics</a>.
