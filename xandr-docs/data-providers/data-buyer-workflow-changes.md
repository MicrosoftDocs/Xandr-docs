# Data Buyer Workflow Changes

<div class="body">

To support the clearing of Data Provider costs and to represent the
distinction between Media costs and Third-party costs (e.g., for user
segments, etc.), a number of changes have been made that may affect your
workflow. These are described below.

<div class="section">

## Adding Data Providers

To access a particular data provider's segment offering, a new workflow
is available to make that process easier.

After selecting the data providers you want access to, refresh the page
and you will see that the data provider's segments are now visible on
your account. At this point, you can now run campaigns targeting these
third-party segments.

## Campaign changes

When creating or editing campaigns, select 
<span class="ph uicontrol">Pay on a per-impression (CPM)
basis</span> under <span class="ph uicontrol">Buying Strategy</span> and
then select the option Bid a Media Cost CPM.

Once set, you can confirm these changes and click
<span class="ph uicontrol">Save</span>. 

When selecting targeting options on the <span class="ph"></span>, if you
select the <span class="ph uicontrol">Edit</span> button in
the <span class="ph uicontrol">Targeting</span> section next to Segment,
the Segments dialog will display.

The available segments (along with prices, when available) will then be
displayed in the Segments dialog.

You can select the various segments that you wish to include in or
exclude from your targeting. To calculate the total costs of all
segments selected, click <span class="ph uicontrol">Calculate Data
Cost</span>.

<div class="note">

<span class="notetitle">Note:</span> For any costs for which the yellow
alert symbol is displayed, <span class="ph">Xandr</span> will not clear.
These alerts denote one of the following conditions:

For segments:

- you have selected a segment for which the Data Provider has not
  supplied a price
- you have selected a segment from a Data Provider who is not
  participating in <span class="ph">Xandr</span> automating clearing
- you have selected a user-created segment (e.g., generated via a pixel)
  not supplied by a Data Provider

For Data Cost Totals:

- one or more of the segments you selected fit the conditions listed
  above for segment alerts

## Line Item Changes

When creating or editing line items, if you
select <span class="ph uicontrol">Cost Plus</span> as your Tracking
Revenue Type, the Total Cost will display instead of the media cost.
