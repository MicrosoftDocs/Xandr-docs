# Microsoft Monetize - Configuring a line item to buy guaranteed outcomes

Guaranteed outcomes are only available on Augmented Line Items (ALI). When creating an ALI to buy guaranteed views or completes, use the settings under Basic Setup.

To configure a line item to buy Guaranteed Views:

1. Under **Ad Type**, select **Banner** or **Video**.
1. Under **Revenue Type**, select **Cost Plus** or **Viewable CPM**.
1. Under **Supply Strategy**, select **Open Exchange** and/or **Deals**.
1. Under **Payment Model**, select **Pay per View**. For more information about which viewability standards you can choose, see [Supported Viewability Standards for Guaranteed Outcomes](supported-viewability-standards-for-guaranteed-outcomes.md).

To configure a line item to buy Guaranteed Completes:

1. Under **Ad Type**, select **Video**.
1. Under **Revenue Type**, select **Cost Plus** or **CPCV**.
1. Under **Supply Strategy**, select **Open Exchange** and/or **Deals**.
1. Under **Payment Model**, select **Pay per Complete**.

    After your Payment Model is configured, the line item is all set to bid and accrue media cost on an outcome basis (vCPM for Views and CPCV for Completes) instead of an impression (CPM) basis. See [Reporting on Guaranteed Outcomes](reporting-on-guaranteed-outcomes.md) for information on how to report on Guaranteed Outcomes-based ALIs.
