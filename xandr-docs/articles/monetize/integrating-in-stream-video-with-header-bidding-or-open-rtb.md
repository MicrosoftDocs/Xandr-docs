# Integrating In-Stream Video with Header Bidding or OpenRTB



If you use header bidding or OpenRTB, you will only need to harvest the
Placement IDs for your placements to integrate them with your code. For
production-scale ID exports, talk to your account manager or file a
support request at https://help.xandr.com.

For a single placement, it's easy to locate the Placement ID by editing
the placement in the Monetize user interface.

The <a href="https://docs.prebid.org/index.md" class="xref"
target="_blank">prebid.org</a> website contains a useful overview of
header bidding as well as detailed information about implementing video
advertising using header bidding. For more information about the
Xandr integration with OpenRTB, see <a

Documentation Center.
