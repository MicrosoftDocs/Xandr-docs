# Digital Platform API - Seller site domain report

The Seller Site Domain Report is designed to give sellers information about what kind of inventory is coming through a publisher. For example, as a seller, you might distribute placement tags to your publishers and then want to verify that those tags are running on the inventory you intended. In addition, this report allows you to:

- See what kind of inventory is coming through a publisher so you can understand how to value it
- Guarantee a certain degree of inventory quality to managed buyers
- Optimize on domains for managed campaigns
- Understand the business impact of Xandr audit and categorization

## Time frame

The `report_interval` field in the JSON request can be set to one of the following:

- yesterday
- last_7_days
- last_30_days
- last_month
- month_to_date

> [!NOTE]
> None of the available time ranges will include today's data. The latest data will be from yesterday.
> [!TIP]
> To run a report for a custom time frame, set the `start_date` and `end_date` fields in your report request. For more details about these fields, see [Report Service](./report-service.md).

**Data retention period**

Data retention period for this report is 60 days.

## Passing Domains Across IFrames

Serving ads inside of iFrames is preferred by publishers for a number of reasons, to include:

- **Increased Security**: For security reasons, communication between iFrames serving from different domains is prohibited by the browser. This is known as the "Same Origin Policy". For more information, see the W3C's [Same Origin Policy](https://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/Same_Origin_Policy) page.

- **Page Load Speed**: Page load speed is guaranteed to be unaffected by advertisements inside iFrames because iFrames allow asynchronous loading of both page content and advertisements. This ensures that the user does not have to wait for the rest of the page to load in the event that serving an advertisement happens more slowly than expected.

For these and other reasons, some networks provide their publishers with an iFrame in which to display advertisements. If this iFrame delivers its contents from the network's domain and not the publisher's, it can lead to difficulties in determining the domain on which an impression actually occurred.

For example, a publisher is given a snippet of HTML code to put on their pages that includes an iFrame referencing a network's domain, `best-network.net`:

```
<!-- Publisher's Web Page >
<iframe src="http://best-network.net"> <!-- iFrame Referencing Network Domain >
    <script src="http://cooladexchange.net/tag?id=12345"></script> <!-- Ad Exchange Placement serving on Network Domain >
</iframe>
```

The iFrame is located on the publisher's web page, but it is serving its contents from the network's domain. Because the page and the iFrame are hosted on different domains, the security restrictions of the "Same Origin Policy" apply, and communication between the publisher's page and the network's iFrame is forbidden. Therefore the network is unable to determine the actual domain of the publisher's page. As a result, the network passes along its own domain as the referring URL to the placement.

## Example

### Create JSON formatted report request

```
$ cat report-request.json

{
  "report": {
    "report_type": "seller_site_domain",
    "columns": [
      "seller_member_id",
      "seller_member_name",
      "placement_id",
      "publisher_id",
      "publisher_name",
      "imps",
      "imp_type_name",
      "audit_type_id",
      "audit_type_name",
      "site_name",
      "site_domain",
      "exposed_for_resale_id",
      "exposed_for_resale",
      "domains_exposed_id",
      "domains_exposed"
    ],
    "filters": [
      "seller_member_id",
      "audit_type_id"
    ],
    "report_interval": "last_7_days",
    "format": "csv"
  }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the report service

```
$ curl -b cookies -X POST -d @report-request.json "https://api.appnexus.com/report"

{
  "response": {
    
    "report_id": "8d3697d23c87e5bebd44370630162990",
    "status": "OK"
  }
}
```

### Download the report data directly to a file

The most common way to download reporting data involves using the `report_id` in a call the **report-download** service, which returns reporting data directly in the file format you specify. In the `curl` all below, we use the `-o` option to specify that the report be saved in a file named `huge-report.csv`. For more details, see the **Using cURL** section in [API Semantics](./api-semantics.md).

```
$ curl -b cookies -o huge-report.csv "https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=8d3697d23c87e5bebd44370630162990"
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.

### Retrieve the report data wrapped in JSON (optional)

You will almost always want to use the method described in *Download the report data directly to a file* above. However, if for some reason you prefer to receive the reporting data wrapped in a JSON response, you may pass the `report_id` to the [Report Service](./report-service.md) directly.

```
$ curl -b cookies "https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=8d3697d23c87e5bebd44370630162990"
```
