# About Flags in Evaluate Orders



Use the flags in Evaluate Orders to find and resolve potential
availability and pricing issues related to the line items on each
proposal.



## Types of Flags

There are three types of flags in Evaluate Orders:

- ! Price flags (CPM order lines only) indicate when the sold CPM value
  is either below the floor price or below the configured discount
  threshold.
- ! Avails flags indicate that an line item is targeting a product that
  does not have enough available impressions to accommodate the order
  line.
- ! Sellthru flags indicate that an order line is targeting a product
  that is more than 50% sold through, though the percentage is
  configurable for your agency.
