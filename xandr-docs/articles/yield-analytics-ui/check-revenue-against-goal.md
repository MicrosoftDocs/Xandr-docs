# Check Revenue Against Goal



Use the Revenue Against Goal widget to provide a snapshot of the order
lines that are most at risk for underdelivery, organized by order, order
line, or advertiser. You can then click on a specific line item to open
a detailed view of its performance, as well as its consumption and
competition.

1.  On the Orders Dashboard page, in the Revenue Against Goal widget,
    click the drop-down arrow to specify whether you want to view
    impressions at risk By Order, By Advertiser,
    or By Order Line.
2.  (Optional) Adjust the date range by clicking the Next x
    Day(s) filter, specifying a new standard or custom date range, and
    clicking Update. 
3.  View the orders or order lines at risk. You can mouse over each
    order or order line in the widget to view its lifetime revenue
    against goal, pacing, and consumption-to-schedule percentage.
4.  Click a specific order line to open a detailed view at the order
    line's performance, as well as its consumption and competition.
    The Order Line Visibility page appears.
5.  (Optional) On the Order Line Visibility page,
    click What should I do? to
    launch Scenario Manager.

To see how all orders or order lines are performing, click the View
All link at the top of the Revenue Against Goal widget.
