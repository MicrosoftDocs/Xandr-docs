# Microsoft Monetize - Competitive exclusion

You can use competitive exclusions to prevent creatives with competitive brands or offer categories from serving alongside each other.

Competitive exclusion settings are available at the advertiser and creative levels. If you set competitive exclusions at the advertiser level, creatives associated with the brands or offer categories that you select will not serve alongside that advertiser's creatives. If you edit the competitive exclusion settings for an individual creative, the
brands or offer categories you select will not serve alongside that specific creative. For more information, see [Self-Auditing Creatives](self-auditing-creatives.md).
