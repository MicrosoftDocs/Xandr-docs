## Configure non programmatic guaranteed (non-PG) deals

1. To configure your deal, select
    **Inventory**
    \> **My Inventory** from the
    left menu.
1. Assign the non-PG deal to the line items. The following steps
    describe assigning the deal to existing and new line items.

**To assign non-guaranteed inventory to existing line items:**

1. Locate the deal in the **Action
    Required** section and select
    **Action**
    \> **Assign to existing line
    item**.
1. In the menu that appears on the right select the following:
    - Advertiser
    - Campaign
    - Insertion order
    - Line item(s)
1. Click **Assign** when you are done.

**To assign non-guaranteed inventory to new line items:**

1. Locate the deal in the **Action
    Required** section and select
    **Action**
    \> **Assign to existing line
    item**.
1. In the following page, enter the below information for your line
    item:
    - Name for your line item. Additionally, you can create your line
      item as a **Draft** if you don't want it to be immediately
      eligible to serve once you've saved it here. If you do want it to
      serve as soon as its start date has occurred, create the line item
      as **Active**.
    - Your line item's [targeting](https://support.google.com/displayvideo/answer/2949929).
    - Your line item's flight dates. For display and video line items,
      you can use [real-time triggers](https://support.google.com/displayvideo/answer/2891312?visit_id=638387401987618631-2767616372&rd=1) to control
      your line item's flight.
    - Your Budget and Pacing settings. DV360 can automatically adjust
      your line item's budget if you've turned on [automatic budget allocation](https://support.google.com/displayvideo/answer/2956568) for the line item's insertion order.
    - Your [bid strategy](https://support.google.com/displayvideo/answer/2997422).
    - The line item's frequency cap.
    - The creatives you want to use with this line item. A line item
      won't be able to serve until one or more creatives assigned to the
      line item is approved.
    - Your method for conversion tracking.
1. Click **Assign** when you are done.

## Configure Programmatic Guaranteed (PG) Deals

1. To configure your deal, select
    **Inventory**
    \> **My Inventory** from the
    left menu. Locate the deal in the **>Action Required** section and
    select
    **Action**
    \> **Configure** on the right.
1. Review the deal details section and make sure the order and product
    details are correct. If not, please reach out to the publisher to
    update.
1. Select whether only partner users or both partner and default
    advertiser users can edit and configure this deal.
1. Next, choose which advertisers have permission to target the
    products. Optionally, you can toggle
    **Assign inventory source to all
    advertisers** to allow any advertiser permission to target the
    products. When you are done, choose the default advertiser. This
    advertiser will use the guaranteed inventory unless specified
    otherwise.
1. Select a campaign. Note that only a campaign under the default
    advertiser can be selected.
1. The next step is to select at least one available creative for each
    of the product sizes and durations specified in the deal. Note that
    only creatives that meet the creative requirements and that are from
    your selected advertisers will be available.
