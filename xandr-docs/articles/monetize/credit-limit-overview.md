# Credit Limit Overview



Xandr offers credit management to support an
enhanced level of service while ensuring that all our partners are
treated fairly.

>

## What is a credit limit?

A credit limit is the maximum allowed exposure on your account. Exposure
(or total balance) is defined as the account balance plus unbilled
activity for all members under that account.
Xandr is not obligated to allow you to purchase
any ad inventory in excess of any credit limit set by us. The credit
limit is shared across all members under a given parent account.



>

## How can I check my balance against my current credit limit?

To view your credit status in the UI, your account needs to be assigned
the Finance Observer role. To have this role assigned, contact your
account representative.

>

Xandr clients can view and track credit status
by both member and account.

- A Member is the
  Xandr platform instance that is currently
  logged in.
- An Account is the relationship
  between Xandr and a business entity. An
  account can have multiple members. If you have a single member, then
  Total Member Balance and
  Total Account Balance are the same.



The following table shows the available information about your credit
status.

## Why is Xandr assigning credit limits?

Credit Limits are used to monitor an account's activity, understanding
when an account may be in financial distress and/or may need its limit
reassessed. On a daily basis, your account exposure (i.e., the total
amount outstanding to Xandr) will be reviewed
against your Credit Limit. If your account balance reaches or surpasses
its Credit Limit, a payment will be required to reduce the account’s
exposure. All UI admin users will receive a notification via email when
thresholds are reached (80% and 100%) to keep account exposure within
the established credit limits.



>

## Does my credit limit affect my bills and rates in any way?

No, your Credit Limit does not affect your account’s contractual rates
and fees. Credit Limits are a tool to help us (and our clients) identify
potential problems and minimize financial risk.



>

## How are Xandr credit limits calculated?

Credit Limits are calculated based on a variety of factors including but
not limited to financial health, payment history, and third party credit
reports.



>

## Can my credit limit change?

Yes, the credit department conducts periodic credit limit reviews.
During the Credit Reviews, a credit limit can be adjusted based on the
following (including but not limited to): account balance, payment
history and spending trends. Credit Limits are set at the sole
discretion of Xandr and we reserve the right to
change or revoke your Credit Limit at any time.



>

## What can affect my Xandr credit limit?

Xandr takes the following into consideration
when reviewing Credit Limits:

- Payment History
- Spending Trends
- Bank References
- Trade References
- Business-changing events, such as a merger or acquisition



>

## What happens if I exceed my credit limit?

>

If you exceed your credit limit, Xandr will
disable your ability to buy third-party inventory. In this event, you
can reactivate buying ability by one of the following:

<li>You may reactivate spending by submitting a payment to <span

this payment applied to. Once payment has been processed, and you have
brought your account below your credit limit, your ability to spend will
be re-activated.</li>
<li>If you anticipate using more credit than your approved credit limit,
you are also able to submit multiple payments to prevent future spending
freezes.</li>
<li>The estimated time frame for processing a wire payment is four (4)
business days for U.S.-based companies and five (5) business days for
non U.S.-based companies after the payment is received in our bank.
Payment by check may take longer to process. Your ability to buy
third-party inventory will not be re-enabled until the payment has been
processed.</li>
