# Set a Recency Cap



You can set recency caps from the
Audience & Location Targeting
section within the Create New Line
Item and Edit Line Item
screens.

>









1.  Under the
    Audience &
    Location Targeting \> Frequency &
    Recency subsection, click the toggle if it's not
    already selected.
2.  Under Recency (how
    often), click the Add another
    cap button.
3.  Enter the number of impressions (imps) to show
    and select how often to show them.
    <div class="itemgroup stepxmp">

    For example, to ensure that a user doesn't see a creative more than
    one time every two days, enter **2** in the text field and select
    days from the pull-down menu.

    

    

    

    <b>Note:</b>
    You can apply only one recency setting.

    Time frames for recency differ from frequency time frames. Frequency
    is based on a calendar timestamp. For example, a frequency setting
    to show four impressions during a one week period will count that
    week as beginning on Sunday and ending on Saturday. Recency is based
    on the time of the impression. If your recency cap is set to show
    one impression every two weeks, the two-week period encompasses the
    14 days from the time the creative is served. For example, if a
    creative is served to the user on July 1, a recency setting of one
    impression every two weeks would keep the user from seeing that
    creative again until at least July 15 regardless of what day of the
    week that is.

    

    
4.  Set the following settings:

    <td class="stentry chdesc" style="vertical-align: top">Once you set a

    cookies you could limit your delivery. If you toggle this option and
    have set a daily frequency cap, <a
