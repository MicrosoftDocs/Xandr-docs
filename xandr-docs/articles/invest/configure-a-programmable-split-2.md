# Configure a programmable split in Microsoft Invest

You can use programmable splits to refine line item targeting and
dynamically adjust bids, budget allocation, and creative allocation
across a line item's targeted inventory. Splits are recommended if you
have sophisticated targeting requirements.

When you create an
[augmented line item (ALI)](create-an-augmented-line-item-ali.md), you also have the option to split up its inventory
using **programmable splits**. Splits allow you to:

- Target different subsections of inventory that match the line item's
  more general criteria
- Dynamically adjust bids based on targeting
- Allocate the line item budget to different targets
- Distribute creatives across the line item's targeted inventory

You define a split by specifying the inventory you want available for
it, using any combination of split settings. These include geography,
inventory performance, and segment information. If you choose, you can
also specify bidding or valuation rules, budget allocations, bidding
priority, and/or creative selection for each split. For more background
information on how splits work, see
[Understanding
Splits](understanding-splits.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Split changes are only applied when you click **Review and Save** on the line item.

1. [Create a Programmable Split](create-a-programmable-split.md)<br>                                                         You can create a new programmable split when creating or     editing an augmented line item.

    You can define targeting parameters for programmable splits that
    expand upon or differ from your line item's targeting parameters.

3. [Set Split Priority](set-split-priority.md)<br>
    When using multiple programmable splits on a line item, you can
    prioritize your splits so that impressions applicable to multiple
    splits get assigned to one split over another.

4. **Optional:**
    [Set Spend Allocation and Capping on a Split](set-spend-allocation-and-capping-on-a-split.md)<br>
    You can set percentages to designate portions of line item's daily

    spend allocation and line item delivery goals.

5. **Optional:**
    [Use Segment Targeting with a Split](use-segment-targeting-with-a-split.md)<br>
    You can target splits based on segment presence or absence, age, or

    You can use split custom macros to pass values through splits'
    creative landing page URLs.

8. **Optional:**
    [Use User Test Groups with a Split](use-user-test-groups-with-a-split.md)<br>
    You can perform A/B testing with user test groups, targeting
