# Working with Targeting Lists





Note: Targeting lists are only
available to Standard Line Items. For an overview of which targeting
options are available to Standard versus Augmented Line items, see
<a href="buy-side-targeting.html" class="xref">Buy-Side Targeting</a>.



Targeting lists are used to place domains or apps with similar
characteristics in groups so that you can easily include or exclude them
from campaign targeting without having to review each domain or app
individually. They're generally used as allowlists or blocklists.
Allowlists contain domains or apps that you want to include in your
campaign targeting, and blocklists contain domains or apps that you want
to exclude.

The pages in this section explain how to create and manage targeting
lists at the network level. For details about including or excluding
targeting lists from a campaign, see
<a href="domain-targeting.html" class="xref">Domain Targeting</a> and
<a href="app-targeting.html" class="xref">App Targeting</a>.



Note: Domain targeting applies only to
**Web** and **Mobile Web** impressions and does not apply to **Mobile
App** impressions. If you have allowed your campaign to serve on mobile
apps while targeting a domain list, the campaign will be unrestricted
when buying mobile app inventory unless you have also applied App List
targeting. To avoid serving on mobile app inventory, switch the
Apps Placements toggle in your
campaign's targeting profile to OFF.
