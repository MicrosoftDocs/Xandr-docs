  start spending according to the requirements.

<figure class="fig fignone">
<p><img src="images/trade-desk-buying-guide-fig19.png" class="image"
width="900" /></p>
</figure>





## Tips & Tricks for PG Workflow

- For PG deals with **GAM**, **Magnite**, **Freewheel**, or
  Bidswitch, the client will utilize
  the Easy Proposal Activation workflow described above.
- If the SSP is not **GAM**, **Magnite**, **Freewheel**, or
  Bidswitch, the publisher will
  provide the client with the targetable deal ID so the client can
  create the PG contract in The Trade Desk platform.



Note:

A few best practices for clients:

- Make sure to leverage the The Trade Desk’s PG workflow on the
  platform.
- Ensure that there are no daily spend caps on the Ad Group or Campaign
  level.
- Confirm that the Ad Groups are in active state.
- Make sure that the agreed ad sizes are trafficked at the Ad Group
  level.
- Make it certain that all parties are aligned on the budget. Ensure
  that the client’s creative meets the specs outline by the publisher
  and that the creative is uploaded 24-48 hours before the launch date.

<li>We encourage the publishers’ sales team to share the deal private

activation on the Third Party PMP Library deals. Please note that you

<li>You may see more adoption in client First Party 1:1 deals after
