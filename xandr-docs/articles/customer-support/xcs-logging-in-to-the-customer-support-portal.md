# Logging in to the Customer Support Portal



If you do not already have a portal account, please visit
the <a href="https://help.xandr.com/" class="xref" target="_blank">Login</a>
page, click Proceed as a Guest, and in
the next page, click Contact Support.
Once your account is created, you will be sent a welcome email with your
user ID and temporary password to log in. You can set your own password
following the link in the welcome mail.



Note: Continuing as a guest without
logging in, gives you limited access to knowledge base articles. If you
contacted support as a guest, without logging in to the portal, you will
only be able to communicate via email.



Once your account is set, you can access the Customer Support Portal by
going directly to
the <a href="https://help.xandr.com/" class="xref" target="_blank">login
page</a> and entering your Email and Password.



Note: The portal account is separate
from  and
<a href="https://docs.xandr.com/" class="xref"
target="_blank">Documentation Portal</a> accounts. You will need to log
in to each system separately. Note that each account may have a
different password.
