# Explore Insertion orders page

The Insertion Orders page is a central hub for advertisers, offering a streamlined interface to provide insights by giving advertisers a single place where they can monitor their Insertion Orders as well as view metrics about the associated Line Items under those Insertion Orders.

### Insertion order context and menu

- When the user clicks the hamburger icon on the Insertion Order sub-navigation, the Insertion Order menu slides out from the left side of the screen. This displays all the insertion orders associated with a particular advertiser. 
- Users can search directly for an Insertion Order by name or ID, as well as filter by state: 
    - Active, or 
    - Favourite
- Upon selecting another Insertion Order, the page reloads, updating the sub-navigation bar, details section, and grid to reflect the context of the new Insertion Order.

### Analytics and settings buttons

To load the Insertion Order details, the user can click the **Settings** button in the top-right corner. This will open the Settings tab and display the Insertion Order details.

To load the Analytics details, click the **Analytics** tab in the top-right corner. This will display the chart section, which features a dual Y-axis bar and line graph based on two metrics.

> [!NOTE]
> The default value of these metrics are always going to be Revenue and CPC.

The left hand side Y-axis will represent the first metric. The values supported here are:

| Metrics | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Media Cost | Cost your network has spent buying media for campaigns under the line item. Media Cost always appears in USD (the currency in which Microsoft Advertising transacts). |
| Viewable Impressions | The number of measured impressions that were viewable, per the IAB Viewability definition, which states that an impression is viewable if 50% of the pixels are in-view during 1 consecutive second. |
| Impressions | Number of impressions for all campaigns under the line item. |
| Revenue | Revenue the advertiser has paid or will pay your network as a result of campaigns under the line item. | 

The right hand side Y-axis will represent the second metric. The values supported here are:

| Metrics | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Impressions | Number of impressions for all campaigns under the line item. |
| Viewable Impressions | The number of measured impressions that were viewable, per the IAB Viewability definition, which states that an impression is viewable if 50% of the pixels are in-view during 1 consecutive second |
| Revenue | Revenue the advertiser has paid or will pay your network as a result of campaigns under the line item. | 
| CPM  | The standard basic pricing model for online advertising in which advertisers pay for every 1,000 impressions of their served creative. |
| Clicks | Number of clicks for all campaigns under the line item. |
| CPC | A payment model in which advertisers pay each time a user clicks on their creative. |
| CTR | Percentage of impressions that resulted in clicks for this campaign. |
| Views | Views denotes the number of views an ad gets when a website or web application is loaded by the user's device. |
| CPCV | The price an advertiser pays every time a video ad runs through to completion. Rather than paying for all impressions, some of which may have been stopped before completion, an advertiser only pays for ads that finished. |
| VCR | The percentage of an advertiser's video creatives that are played from start to finish. This is also known as a View Through Rate (VTR) or Video Completion Rate (VCR). |
| LTR | The Audio Listen-Through Rate (LTR) is calculated by dividing the number of completed listens by the number of impressions and then multiplying the result by 100%. |
| Conversions | The number of conversions that were attributed to inventory that you purchased from the seller. |
| CPA | A payment model in which advertisers pay for every action, such as a sale or registration, completed as a result of a visitor clicking on their creative. An "acquisition" is also referred to as a "conversion." |
| Listens | Listen-through targeting allows traders to target audio inventory with a projected percentage of audio completions. The listen-through rate is defined as the number of audio completions / number of ad impressions for a particular line item. |
| Margins | The designated currency amount paid to a network as compensation for managed-advertising services. |

### Billing period progress

- Click the Billing Period dropdown to view a list of each billing period under different metrics. 
- When you select an option, the Analytics tab updates to reflect the metrics values for that Insertion order (on the chart) and the average metrics information for the billing period progress and average metrics section. 
- The Billing Period Progress bar represents the pacing of the insertion order, showing how much of the budget has been spent in relation to how much should be spent at this point in the current billing period.
