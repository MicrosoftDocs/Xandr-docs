## Removing Shared Segments

There are situations when a segment will need to be removed from our
platform. Since there are complex dependencies associated with segment
targeting and these dependencies can affect spend for a campaign, it is
crucially important to communicate clearly with your clients about
changes to these segments.

For instance, let's take a campaign negatively targeting ("excluding") a
contextual segment for adult content. If this segment is removed from
the platform, it could potentially cause the campaign to spend
unchecked. For this reason, it is necessary to reach out to your clients
when deprecating a segment.

As a general rule, our mutual clients should be aware of:

- The change in status for the segment (e.g., that it is being
  deprecated or deleted)
- The date on which the segment will no longer be available
- The potential impact to their campaigns if no changes are made
