# Integrating in-stream video with header bidding or OpenRTB

If you use header bidding or OpenRTB, you will only need to harvest the Placement IDs for your placements to integrate them with your code. For production-scale ID exports, talk to your account manager or file a support request on our [Microsoft Advertising Customer Support Portal](https://support.ads.microsoft.com).

For a single placement, it's easy to locate the Placement ID by editing the placement in the Monetize user interface.

The [prebid.org](https://docs.prebid.org/index.html) website contains a useful overview of header bidding as well as detailed information about implementing video advertising using header bidding. For more information about the Microsoft Advertising integration with OpenRTB, see [Incoming Bid Requests from SSPs](../supply-partners/incoming-bid-request-from-ssps.md) on our Documentation Center.
