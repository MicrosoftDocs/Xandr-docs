# Under the Hood of Your Browser



If you want to understand what's going on behind the scenes when ad
space is bought and sold and ads displayed on the Internet, it's
important to know about the background processes that occur when
browsers are running. This page contains information about tools that
will help you access and understand that activity. 



## Ghostery

Let's say you visit the website swap-bot.com, which organizes swaps of
crafts and other items among users of the site. (Full disclosure:
<a href="http://swap-bot.com" class="xref"
target="_blank">swap-bot.com</a> is a side project of a former
Xandr engineer and his wife.) You type
swap-bot.com into your browser's address bar, and your browser starts
downloading content from a swap-bot.com server somewhere. But, as your
page is loading, your browser also starts passing information and
requests to other sites and servers, such as DoubleClick, Quantcast,
Google Analytics, and others. (To those in the ad tech industry, when a
browser sends information and makes requests, it's known as
"making calls" or "calling" servers.) How would you know this? And what
are those calls for?

There are several great (and free!) tools that can teach you more about
what's going on behind the scenes of your Internet activity, such
as <a href="http://www.ghostery.com" class="xref"
target="_blank">Ghostery</a>, a plugin that you can easily add to any
major browser. When you visit a webpage, Ghostery tells you via a little
box in the right hand corner of the page what calls are being made in
conjunction with this page.

## Pixels, Beacons, Trackers, Oh My

In the above example, DoubleClick, Adsense, Project Wonderful, and
Rocket Fuel are all ad serving companies, which swap-bot.com uses to
figure out the right ads to put on their pages. The calls being made are
generated by <a href="ad-tags.md" class="xref">ad tags</a> and they
are requesting an ad to be shown in a specific slot on the page.

The other calls, Comscore Beacon, Google Analytics, and Quantcast, don't
result in content being placed on the page. This type of call has a
variety of names, including pixel, web bug, tracker, and beacon. A
pixel's goal is to send information about your browser's activity to a
system other than the one you are directly contacting, without making
any perceptible change to the page.

Pixels are commonly used to help the publisher of the website see what
kind of traffic they're getting using a web analytics product such as
Google Analytics; your browser "pings" Google Analytics every time it
loads a swap-bot.com page and GA can later tell you that there were 1000
page loads a day from 500 different browsers. It can tell which swap
page is the most popular, or what search terms led people to the site,
or how much traffic comes through RSS feeds. Swap-bot.com also has
pixels for Quantcast and Comscore, which collect traffic information
which advertisers can use to decide where to display ads.

Ghostery may not show a 100% complete picture of the activity that
happens when you visit a page. A site could be contacting another system
server-side without going through the browser. But it's a strong start
and a nice way to see what companies are out there.

A note on privacy: These calls don't happen without the cooperation of
the website you are visiting. The webmaster had to place the pixel on
the page. Read
<a href="https://www.xandr.com/privacy/platform-privacy-policy/"
class="xref" target="_blank">our privacy policy</a> for a full
explanation of what information websites use
Xandr's technology to collect, and how it's
protected.





## Digging Deeper: Debuggers

If you want to get even more information about browser calls, you can
use one of several debugging tools that show and analyze your browser
traffic. Debuggers will help you if you're tracking down something
specific, like why a pixel isn't firing properly.

Below is a screenshot of a Firefox add-on called
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tamper-data/"
class="xref" target="_blank">Tamper Data</a> recording the activity on
the swap-bot.com page. You can see the Quantcast, Google, and
Xandr ad calls, and in the last line you can see
the page retrieving its favicon (a file containing one or more small
icons) from some folder in the website's content management system.

Here are a few other debuggers:

## View a Webpage's Source Code

For any website you visit, it's possible to see the HTML and JavaScript
code that your browser executes, causing content to show up in your
screen, and causing the first round of calls described above. For
example, if you go to swap-bot.com using Firefox, and right-click on the
page, you'll see an option called "page source." This option shows the
below (truncated) code. You'll notice the Quantcast pixel that Ghostery
alerted us to above.

## Charles Web Debugging Proxy

It's not always easy in web and Internet development to know where
exactly something went wrong. Tools such as Charles Web Debugging Proxy
acts as an intermediary between your web browser (such as Internet
Explorer, Chrome, Safari) and the Internet. You can install it on your
computer, and your web browser can then be configured to access the
Internet through the <a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com" class="xref"
target="_blank">Charles Web Debugging Proxy</a>. This is useful because
it records all of the data that is sent and received, making it easier
to know exactly what is happening, especially when trying to diagnose
and troubleshoot an issue.





## Summary

When you have an understanding of the available tools and background
processes that browsers incorporate to monitor, track, and report on ad
serving activity – it allows you to better select the appropriate tools
and methods for your specific need. This ultimately equates to improved
ad targeting and increased revenue.
