# Opt out of gambling ads

Microsoft Advertising allows gambling ads in certain countries where such advertising is not prohibited. If you don't want to permit gambling ads to serve on your or your publishers' inventory, this page describes how to ban gambling ads from serving on such inventory.

## Option 1. Exclude gambling ads from several publishers at once

Complete the attached [Excel Worksheet](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fdownload.microsoft.com%2Fdownload%2Fe%2Fe%2F5%2Fee544211-092a-45c4-8076-57b5c5aaceb3%2F28%2520Dec%25202023%2Fgambling-publisher-opt-out-worksheet.xlsx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK) by entering a list of Microsoft Advertising publisher IDs or codes. These IDs and codes represent inventory where you don't want gambling ads to run. Once you've finished completing the worksheet, email it to [gamblingoptout@appnexus.com](mailto:gamblingoptout@appnexus.com). (You'll need to CC: your Microsoft Advertising representative as well.) We will update your Ad Quality settings to opt out of gambling ads on those publishers.

## Option 2. Exclude gambling ads from all publishers

If you don't want to permit gambling ads to serve on any of your publishers, follow these steps:

### Step 1. Navigate to the network ad quality manager

Open the network Ad Quality Manager by navigating to **Network** \>  **Ad Quality**.

### Step 2. Open the category eligibility settings dialog

Locate the **Categories** section. Find and click the **Edit** button to open the **Category Eligibility Settings** dialog.

### Step 3. Ban the gambling category

Search for the **Gambling** category and click the **Edit** link. Then change the status to **Banned**, and click **Save**.

## Option 3. Exclude gambling ads on a per-publisher basis

If you don't want to permit gambling ads to serve on specific publishers' inventory, follow these steps for each publisher:

### Step 1. Navigate to the publisher ad quality manager

Open the publisher Ad Quality Manager by navigating to **Publishers** \> **Ad Quality**.

### Step 2. Ban the gambling category

The Ad Quality Manager shares the same user interface for publishers and networks. As detailed in **Option 2** above, update Ad Quality settings for the publisher to set the **Gambling** category to **Banned**.
