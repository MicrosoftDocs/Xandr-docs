# Floor rule targeting

When creating a floor rule, you can target the rule based on several difference targeting criteria. The following sections describe the different types of floor rule targeting.

## Frequency targeting

When creating a floor rule, you can target the rule based on the number of times a user has viewed an impression. You can set this rule based on either the minimum or maximum number of times the user has viewed an impression, or you can set both values to define a range to which this rule applies.

From the **Create New Floor Rule** or **Edit Floor Rule** page, locate **Targeting**.

- Select the **Scope** to indicate whether you would like frequency to be calculated based on views on inventory across the entire platform (**Platform Wide**), or only views on the publisher's inventory (**Publisher Specific**).
- Check the **User seen at most \_\__times** checkbox and then type the maximum number of impression views to which the rule will apply.
- Check the **User seen at least \_\__times** checkbox and then type the minimum number of impression views you want to user to experience before the rule applies.
- If you choose to set a minimum and/or maximum value, you can select the option to **Apply to users without a valid Microsoft Advertising User ID**. Doing this might violate frequency caps.

## Geography targeting

When creating floor rules, you can target users based on the geographic location of the users.

From the **Create New Floor Rule** or **Edit Floor Rule** page, locate **Targeting**. Next to **Inventory**, click **Edit**.

See [Geography Targeting](geography-targeting.md) for details on the different types of geography targeting.

## Segment targeting

By default, floor rules target all users. Segment targeting allows you to narrow the users targeted by included or excluding the segments they occupy.

From the **Create New Floor Rule** or **Edit floor rule** page, locate **Targeting**. Next to **Segment**, click **Edit**.

See [Segment Targeting](segment-targeting.md) for details on setting up segment targeting using boolean logic.

## Inventory targeting

When creating or editing a floor rule, you can select specific inventory you would like the rule to apply to. You can target direct inventory placements, universal categories, or custom categories.

## Getting there

From the **Create New Floor Rule** or **Edit floor rule** page, locate **Targeting**. Next to **Inventory**, click **Edit**.

## Target direct inventory

By default, the floor rule targets all of your direct inventory. However, you can narrow your targeting to include or exclude specific placement groups or placements.

To target direct inventory, click the the **Direct Inventory** tab. Click **Placement Groups** to include or exclude groups of placements, and **Placements** to include or exclude specific placements.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, you are in browse mode, which allows you to browse or search the placements or placement groups. To manage objects by ID, click **text**. In text mode, type one or more IDs, separated by commas, spaces, or lines, then click **Include** or **Exclude**.

## Target custom categories

By default, your campaign will target all custom categories. However, you can narrow your targeting to include or exclude specific custom categories.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Custom Categories** tab shows you the custom categories that you have applied to your own placement groups and/or placements for direct buying as well as the custom categories that other sellers have exposed to you for third-party buying. See [Content Category Targeting](content-category-targeting.md) for more information.

Click the **Custom Categories** tab to include or exclude categories in the floor rule.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When targeting more than one custom category, the categories have an OR relationship. For example, if you include "Custom Category 1" and "Custom Category 2", you will bid on inventory that is in **either** category. The inventory does not need to be in both categories.

## Target universal categories

By default, your campaign will target all universal categories. However, you can narrow your targeting to include or exclude specific universal categories.

> [!NOTE]
> Universal categories are defined by Microsoft Advertising. When Microsoft Advertising reviews inventory, we apply these categories based on the inventory's content. For example, a car dealership placement group would be assigned to the "Autos & Vehicles" category. Sellers can apply universal categories when self-reviewing inventory as well.

Click the the **Universal Categories** tab to include or exclude universal categories in the floor rule.

- Click **Categories** to see the top-level universal categories. You can either include or exclude top-level categories or drill into a category to view its child categories.
- Click **Sub-Categories** to see the child universal categories in the context of their parent categories. You can either include or exclude sub-categories. Note that when you exclude a top-level category, its sub-categories are not available for further inclusion or exclusion.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When targeting more than one universal category, the categories have an OR relationship. For example, if you target the "News" and "Finance" categories, you will bid on inventory that is in **either** category. The inventory does not need to be in both categories.

## Page properties targeting

When creating a floor rule, you can target users based on the position of the tag on the page or based on values passed in the query string of the ad call.

> [!TIP]
> Since tag position and query strings are passed by the seller, these targeting options are therefore most often used when buying direct inventory.

size target** boxes, and then clicking **Add Size** . The size you have added will be displayed under the **Custom Sizes** header.
