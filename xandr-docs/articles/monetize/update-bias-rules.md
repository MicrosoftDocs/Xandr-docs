The **Bias Rule Manager** screen lists all
bias rules for the publisher, allows you to view and edit rule details,
and offers bulk editing options.

## Getting to the bias Rule Manager Screen

To reach this screen, select **Publishers** \> **Bias Rules** from the
navigation menu, and then select a publisher when you are prompted.

## Viewing bias rule details

To view details about a bias rule, select the rule by clicking anywhere
in the row except the checkbox. The **Bias
Settings** section then shows you the following:

- **Bias Direction**: The type of bias applied to a buyer or buyer group;
  positive (bid preference), negative (bid deterrent), or neutral (no
  bias applied).
- **Applied To**: The number of buyers or buyer groups that the bias
  direction has been applied to.

The **Rule Details** section then shows
you the following:

- **Name**: The name that you provided for
  the rule.
- **ID**: The rule's ID.
- **Priority**: The rule's priority. Rules
  are checked against the impression in priority order.

For conditional bias rules, the **Rule
Details** section will also display the following (not shown in
screen shot):

- **Audience Targeting**: An overview of
  the rule's audience targeting settings.
- **Supply Targeting**: An overview of the
  rule's supply targeting settings.

## Filtering by Name/ID

You can find all bias rules whose names or IDs include a specific string
of characters or numbers. Click **Filter**
and then enter the characters in the
**Name/ID** field.

## Duplicating bias rules

You can duplicate one or more bias rules directly from the
**Bias Rule Manager** screen. Check the
checkbox for each rule that you want to duplicate and click
**More Actions** \> **Duplicate**.

## Deleting bias rules

You can delete bias rules directly from the
**Bias Rule Manager** screen. Check the
checkbox for each rule that you want to delete and click
**More Actions** \> **Delete**.

A confirmation dialog lists the rule(s) to be deleted. Click
**Confirm** to complete the action.

> [!WARNING]
> Be careful when deleting bias rules. As soon as a rule is deleted it **immediately** stops applying to transactions; this may have significant revenue repercussions.
