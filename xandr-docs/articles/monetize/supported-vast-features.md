# Microsoft Monetize - Supported VAST Features

The Xandr platform supports a variety of VAST features such as skipoffset and ad verification. Our VAST features are compatible with certain VAST versions. VAST versions 2.0 through 4.0 support backwards feature compatibility. However, if a publisher doesn't support a particular VAST version, then implementation of certain features on that publisher's player won't be possible.

The following table provides feature descriptions and indicates the VAST versions that are supported:

| VAST Feature | Description | VAST 2.0 | VAST 3.0 | VAST 4.0 | VAST 4.1 | VAST 4.2 |
