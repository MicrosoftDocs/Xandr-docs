# View Order Information for a Specific Parent Product



By default, the Orders Dashboard page displays at-risk impressions,
consumed impressions, and order performance for your entire network.
However, you can view them for a specified parent product.

1.  At the top of the Orders Dashboard,
    click Analyzed Network.
2.  In the Parent Product Filter dialog that appears, select the parent
    product for the order, or type in the box to find a specific
    product.
3.  Click Update.

To reset the Orders Dashboard to your entire analyzed network,
enter Analyzed Network in the Parent Product Filter dialog.
