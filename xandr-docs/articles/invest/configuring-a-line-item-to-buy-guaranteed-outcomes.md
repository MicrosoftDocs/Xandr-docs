# Configuring a line item to buy Guaranteed outcomes in Microsoft Invest

Guaranteed outcomes are only available on Augmented Line Items (ALI).
When creating an ALI to buy guaranteed views or completes, use the
settings under Basic Setup.

To configure a line item to buy Guaranteed Views:

1. Under Ad Type, select **Banner** or
    **Video**.
1. Under Revenue Type, select **Cost Plus** or **Viewable CPM**.
1. Under Supply Strategy, select **Open Exchange** and/or **Deals**.
1. Under Payment Model, select **Pay per View**. For more information about which viewability standards
    you can choose, see
    [Supported Viewability Standards for Guaranteed Outcomes](supported-viewability-standards-for-guaranteed-outcomes.md).

To configure a line item to buy Guaranteed Completes:

1. Under Ad Type, select **Video**.
1. Under Revenue Type, select **Cost Plus** or **CPCV**.
1. Under Supply Strategy, select **Open Exchange** and/or **Deals**.
1. Under Payment Model, select **Pay per Complete**.

After your Payment Model is configured, the line item is all set to
    bid and accrue media cost on an outcome basis (vCPM for Views and
    CPCV for Completes) instead of an impression (CPM) basis. See
    [Reporting on Guaranteed Outcomes](reporting-on-guaranteed-outcomes.md) for information on how to report on
    Guaranteed Outcomes-based ALIs.
