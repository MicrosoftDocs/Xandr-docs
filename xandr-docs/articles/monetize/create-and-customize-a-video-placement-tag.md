# Create and customize a video placement tag

Tag customization requires you to build on the root tag by identifying the correct handler for your implementation, then adding a combination of required and optional parameters.

To customize a video placement tag for use in a tag implementation:

1. On the **Placement** screen in Monetize, click **Export Tag** to export the root of the tag.

    A typical root tag looks like this: `https://secure.adnxs.com/ptv?id=12345678`.

1. If the page is secure, update the endpoint to `https://`

1. The default tag uses the `ptv` handler. See the following table to determine whether you should replace the handler with a different one.

    | Placement type | Client-Side Handler | Server-Side Handler |
    |---|---|---|
    | single ad | `ptv` | `ssptv` |
    | ad pod | `vmap` | `ssvmap` |

    > [!NOTE]
    > Some video players don't support VMAP. If your player doesn't support it, you can implement ad pods using the `/ptv` or `/ssptv` handler.

1. Add the required parameters to your tag. For  more information, see:
