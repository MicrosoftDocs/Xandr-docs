Viewing Visual Success Data

Visual Success is a tool designed to help campaign managers achieve
better overall performance. It provides easy access to performance,
delivery, and other metrics for your line item. You can use these
metrics to see how the campaigns under your line item are performing as
a group, and assess for possible trouble spots at the campaign and line
item levels.

With Visual Success, you can:

- View flight progress, delivery, performance, and margin
- Scan for problems using easy-to-read data visualizations
- Keep track of how well line items are pacing to goals
- Hover over the visuals to see specific data for a single day



Visual Success features appear at the top of the
Line Item Details screen. The
metrics sections and graphs show important information about the line
item's flight, delivery, performance and margin.

<div class="bodydiv">

Basic Setup

- State: The state of the line item
  (active or inactive).
- Lifetime Budget: The lifetime budget
  for the line item (in impressions or revenue).
- Daily Budget: The daily budget for
  the line item, in impressions or revenue.
- Revenue Type: The basis on which the
  advertiser has agreed to pay you. For example, CPM (per thousand
  impressions) or CPA (per conversion). For more information about each
  revenue type, see
  <a href="create-a-standard-line-item.html" class="xref">Create a
  Standard Line Item</a>.
- Revenue Value: The amount that the
  advertiser will pay you for the specified revenue type.
- Conversion Tracking: The name and ID
  of each conversion pixel associated to this line item.
- Performance Goal Type: The type of
  goal that the advertiser wants you to achieve (CPC, CPA, CTR). A
  performance goal is used to achieve a goal that is different from how
  the advertiser has agreed to pay you. For example, the advertiser
  wants to pay a CPM but expects you to meet a $50 CPA goal. For more
  information about performance goals, see
  <a href="create-a-standard-line-item.html" class="xref">Create a
  Standard Line Item</a>.

Frequency Caps

- **Frequency Caps**: How frequently the creatives associated to
  campaigns under this line item can be shown. This can be:
  - Number of creatives shown to a given user over the lifetime of the
    line item
  - Number of creatives shown to a given user per day
  - Number of minutes/hours/days that must pass before a given user can
    be shown another creative
- **Cookies**: Whether or not the creatives associated to campaigns
  under this line item can be shown to users without cookies. Be aware
  that frequency caps do not apply to such users.



Note: Frequency caps and whether to
show to cookieless users can also be set at the advertiser, insertion
order, campaign, and creative levels, or any combination of the five
levels. The most restrictive setting always takes precedence. For more
information, see <a href="frequency-and-recency-caps.html" class="xref"
title="From the Audience &amp; Location Targeting section, you can apply frequency and recency caps to your line item to prevent overexposure by limiting how many (frequency) and how often (recency) creatives are shown to a user. You can use the Creative Frequency and Recency Report to view how often and how frequently users are viewing a specific advertiser&#39;s creatives.">Frequency
Targeting</a>.



Reporting Labels

This section shows if a Trafficker,
Salesperson, or
Campaign Type has been associated with
the line item. If so, you can run reports by these labels. For example,
you might associate a salesperson with each of your line items and then
run a report grouped by salesperson to compare line item performance
across salespersons.

Commissions

This section shows any commissions that have been associated with the
line item. Commissions let you attribute revenue to third-parties. They
are deducted from the booked revenue (the amount the advertiser pays
you) of the line item and can be defined either as a percentage of

see <a href="broker-fees.html" class="xref">Broker Fees</a>.

This section shows the names and IDs of all insertion orders to which
the line item is associated.

section shows the landing page URL to use for the creatives. Note that
you can set a dynamic landing page at the campaign level as well. For
more information, see <a href="dynamic-landing-pages.html" class="xref"
title="As an advertiser, you may wish to send users to different landing pages or compare the performance of different landing pages. To accomplish this, you can associate a landing page URL with a line item or campaign. This landing page will then be available for association with any creatives that are attached to that line item or campaign.">Dynamic
