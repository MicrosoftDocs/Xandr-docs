# Video Inventory Recommendations



To help traders discover new video inventory and maximize scale and
performance, Monetize provides detailed
recommendations at the line item level. These recommendations identify
performant seller/domain combinations and can be found under the
Video Inventory Recommendations
section (under the Analytics tab) of
each video ALI. You can

title="To act on the new inventory recommendations found under your video line item&#39;s Analytics tab (in the Video Inventory Recommendations section), you can download them in a CSV file for analysis by an inventory manager, or select individual recommendations to create a new line item-level allowlist. For details on how these recommendations are generated, see Video Inventory Recommendations">download
your recommendations to a CSV file, or use them to efficiently create
new allowlists for targeting</a>.





<b>Note:</b> This feature is in **Open Beta**.
It is still under development and may be subject to change without
notice.



Video inventory recommendations are based on:



- Brand category-level data that predicts video completion rate. Brand
  categories are high-level content categories such as Apparel or
  Financial.
- The brand safety targeting, device type targeting, and country
  targeting specified on your line item.
- Inventory with at least 10,000 available 7-day video slots across your
  targeted inventory.





<b>Note:</b> Recommendations are only
available for mid-flight line items: you'll start to see recommendation
data the day after spending occurs.





The same domain might be available through multiple sellers, resulting
in more than one recommendation for the site. To ensure recommendations
are new and relevant, Xandr filters out any
inventory that is already part of an allowlist or blocklist, or that
your ads have already served on for this line item.

Recommendations include the following information for each recommended
domain/seller combination:

- 7-day video avails based on the line item's current targeting settings
- 30-day platform-wide CPCV, CPM, VCR and IAB viewability rate

Recommendations are refreshed daily.
