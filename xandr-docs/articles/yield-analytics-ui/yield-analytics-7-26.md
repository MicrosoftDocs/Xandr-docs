# Yield Analytics 7.26





## Feature Enhancements

Direct Channel -  Within the revamped Channel Management framework, we
have reintroduced Direct Channel.  It is considered it’s own channel. 
It compares direct sold inventory by filtering on guaranteed inventory
that is mapped to SSP inventory.





## Fixes

Order Line Visibility Complete Report Export contains the Yield
Analytics Order Line ID, instead of the External Order Line ID.
