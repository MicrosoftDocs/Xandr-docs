Xandr Outstream Video offers the capability to
insert a smart player into your page content that will expand when the
container is in view and, depending on its configuration, only play
video and or sound based on publisher-defined criteria. The player is
highly flexible: it works in Flash and HTML5, supports VPAID Flash and
VPAID JavaScript, and works on desktop and mobile web. Video demand is
delivered as VAST XML via RTB. Pages are tagged using <a
href="seller-tag/seller-tag/seller-tag.md"
class="xref" target="_blank">Xandr's seller
tag</a> (AST) which supports multiple placements per page and multiple
media types per placement.
