**Intervals**

Intervals determine how your data is grouped together into rows in the
report response. The following is a complete list of intervals available
for reports. However, all intervals are not available for every report.

- Hourly: Data is grouped into rows by the hour.
- Daily: Data is grouped into rows by the day.
- Monthly: Data is grouped into rows by the month.
- Cumulative: Data is grouped together in one figure, covering the
  entire selected time range.

> [!NOTE]
> Hourly impression data is available and spans 13 full months. For impressions that are older than 13 months, hourly data is aggregated into one row with 'YYYY-MM-DD 00:00:00' as the hour ('YYYY-MM-DD' is the UTC day in which the activity happened). This will make it look as though all activity happened at midnight.
>
> All daily data that is older than 13 months will be timestamped based on the UTC time zone.

## To run your report

Follow these steps to run your report.

1.  1.  Select **Reporting** from the
        appropriate top menu (depending on how your account has been
        configured).
        1.  Or, from the Publishers top menu, click on
            **Prebid Server Premium** \> **Analytics** \> **Prebid Server Analytics**.
    1.  Select the relevant report from the list. The
        **Report** screen shows the
        available filters, dimensions, and delivery options for the
        report. The selections you make here will determine what report
        data is delivered to you, and how.

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > For an explanation of how grouping and filtering work, see [Dimensions, Metrics, Filtering, and Grouping](dimensions-metrics-filtering-and-grouping.md).

        
    1.  Select the relevant filters to limit the data displayed to just
        the information you want. For example, rather than running a
        report that shows impressions for all inventory sources, you may
        want to list results for just a select few. When you select a
        filter (by clicking **Edit**), a
        selection panel appears. Select items in the **Available** list
        (left), then click **Add** to
        include them in the **Chosen** list (right).
    1.  Group by Dimension. Grouping allows you to display rows of data
        in the order you prefer.

        > [!WARNING]
        > The more dimensions you group by, the larger the data set that is returned. Larger data sets can take substantially longer to process. Be sure to group using only the dimensions you need.
        
    1.  Choose a delivery option. Once you've selected your filters and
        grouped by your chosen dimensions, you need to choose a delivery
        method. Available delivery methods include:
        - **Run now, show results in screen**: For smaller amounts of
          data, you may want to view the report as soon as possible in
          your browser. You can download the report in XLSX, CSV,
          Excel/TSV and JSON format. However, there is a limit of
          100,000 rows per report when downloading as XLSX and Excel
          file.
        - **Run in background, notify me when results are ready to
          view**: A popup notification will let you know when the report
          is ready to view or download.

        > [!TIP]
        > The maximum size of the report that can be downloaded from the UI is 100 MB. Also, there is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when downloading as XLSX and Excel file. If the size of the report is more than that, you can try to download it using the [API](../digital-platform-api/report-service.md) for that reporting service (The limit here is 10 million rows).

        - **Export, send results via
          email**: Run the report in the background and email the
          results to one or more email addresses.
        - **Save as report template**: Save your selected report
          settings so that you can run this report again in the future.
          You can name this template using the text entry field under
          **Name this report** (its
          checkbox is auto-selected when you choose this option). A
          saved report can be rerun from the
          **Your Reports** screen.
        - **Add to scheduled reports**: Run this report automatically at
          specified times and have it sent to one or more email
          addresses.
        - **Name this report**: Give this report with its current
          settings a name for future reference.
