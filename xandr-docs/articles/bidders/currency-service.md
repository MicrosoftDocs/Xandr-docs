# Bidders - Currency service

> [!WARNING]
> The API Currency Service is available to clients solely to reconcile amounts paid or received by them resulting from their transactions through the Xandr Platform and may not be used by clients for any other purpose.

This is a read-only service that shows you the list of currencies that
you can set a line-item or insertion-order to use. 

For buy side Open RTB for bidders, you can send currencies other than
USD in the outgoing bid request to bidders and accept other currencies
in the response. In order for a bidder to change currency of their bid,
they must send the "cur" field. If the "cur" field is not specified, it
will be defaulted to USD. A bidder can respond with any currency,
regardless of what value is set in the default currency. They just need
to indicate the currency in the "cur" field and no additional enablement
is required. 

For sell side Open RTB, by default USD is used as currency where the
"cur" field is ignored. If the seller member has a member entitlement
for seller_bid_currency explicitly set up, the "cur" field in bid
requests is respected.

> [!NOTE]
> To show conversion rates, pass `show_rate=true` in the URL. You can also retrieve a past day's rate by passing in `ymd=YYYYMMDD` via the URL.
 
> [!WARNING]
> * When querying the currency API (eg: `rate_per_usd`), the service is currently returning all the correct values, with the exception for `last_modified`. The actual rates are accurate, and the API is returning updated exchange rates. Currently, use the `as_of` column instead of `last_modified` to know the version of the exchange rate being returned.
