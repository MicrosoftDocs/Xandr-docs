# Hacks-Hackers developer glossary

A group called Hacks/Hackers brings together writers and developers. They have written a glossary, which you may find interesting if you are new to developer culture. Here is their description:

Confused? So were we, which is why we put together this Hacks/Hackers Survival Glossary as an explanation of terms that help us understand the information landscape. This is a crowdsourced document that provides a guide to technologies involved in modern content distribution, coordinated by Hacks/Hackers, a grassroots group that brings journalists and technologists together. Don't know Drupal from Django, API from Ajax, mashup from metadata? This is the list for you. It's written for intelligent non-techies in (mostly) plain English. Feel free to distribute or contribute.
