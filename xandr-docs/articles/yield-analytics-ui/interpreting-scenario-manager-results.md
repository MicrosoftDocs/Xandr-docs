# Interpreting scenario manager results

When viewing the simulation results, first check the Scenario Summary Indicators panel.

- The **Revenue Impacts** section displays the potential net gain and losses, compared to the total net gain and loss.
- The **Change Impacts** section shows how many order lines and products would be impacted by the overlap.

You can view the most impacted order lines (i.e., gained or lost revenue) to see how the scenario's change would overlap with the rest of your inventory.
