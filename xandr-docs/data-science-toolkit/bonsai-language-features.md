# Data Science Toolkit - Bonsai language features

This page lists the Bonsai Language features that you can use to evaluate impressions as part of your custom model logic. For each
feature, we explain the syntax and provide an example to demonstrate usage.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Bids that are negative or zero (0) are not supported unless explicitly specified in the feature description. Do not use these expressions or unexpected results may occur. It is best to specify no_bid explicitly using [Smart Leaves](bonsai-smart-leaves.md).
> - The bids calculated by the model are always expressed in the currency set on the advertiser, even if you have specified a different currency for the campaign.

## Simple features

## Compound features

The simple features above let you evaluate a single aspect of the impression (country, cookie age, mobile app, etc.). The compound [Segment](#segment) and [Frequency/Recency](#frequencyrecency) features are more nuanced; they let you evaluate multiple attributes of these features, such as the age of a segment or the segment value.

### Segment

- [Segment Presence/Absence](#segment-presenceabsence)
- [Segment Age](#segment-age)
- [Segment Value](#segment-value)

#### Segment presence/absence

Evaluate impressions based on the presence of the user in a first-party or third-party segment.

**Keyword**: `segment[ID]` where `ID` is the segment ID. Use [Segment Service](../digital-platform-api/segment-service.md) to retrieve segment IDs.

**Attribute**: None

**Operator**: None for presence, `not` for absence.

**Value**: None

**Example**:

```pre
if any segment[12345], segment[23456], segment[34567]:
5
elif any segment[76543], segment[65432], segment[54321]:
3
elif not segment[9999]:
1
else:
0.2
```

#### Segment age

Evaluate impressions based on the minutes since the user was added to a first-party or third-party segment.

> [!NOTE]
> If the user is not in the segment, this feature evaluates to `False`.

**Keyword**: `segment[ID]` where `ID` is the segment ID. Use [Segment Service](../digital-platform-api/segment-service.md) to retrieve segment IDs.

**Attribute**: `.age`

**Operator**: `<` , `>` , or `=`

**Value**: Positive integer representing the minutes since the user was added to the segment.

**Example**:

```pre
if segment[12345].age < 5:
2
else:
0.2
```

#### Segment value

Evaluate impressions based on a user-defined value. The value may be passed in a number of ways, for example, through the Batch Segment
Service or a first-party or third-party segment query string. For more information on passing values through segment query strings, see "[Segment Pixels Advanced](../invest/segment-pixels-advanced.md)" in documentation (customer login required).

> [!NOTE]
> If the user is not in the segment, this feature evaluates to `False`.

**Keyword**: `segment[ID]` where `ID` is the segment ID. Use [Segment Service](../digital-platform-api/segment-service.md) to retrieve segment IDs.

**Attribute**: `.value`

**Operator**: `<` , `>` , or `=`

**Value**: Non-zero, positive integer representing the user-defined value.

**Example**:

```pre
if segment[12345].value = 5:
2
else:
0.2
```

### Frequency/Recency

- [Frequency Presence/Absence](#frequency-presenceabsence)
- [Lifetime Frequency](#lifetime-frequency)
- [Daily Frequency](#daily-frequency)
- [Recency Presence/Absence and Data](#recency-presenceabsence-and-data)

#### Frequency presence/absence

Evaluate whether or not frequency data is available for the user. This can be determined for all ads under an advertiser, line item, or
campaign.

**Keyword**: `frequency`

**Attribute**: `OBJECT[ID].` where `OBJECT` is `advertiser`, `line_item`, or `campaign`, and `ID` is the object ID. Use the [Advertiser Service](../digital-platform-api/advertiser-service.md), [Line Item Service](../digital-platform-api/line-item-service.md), or [Campaign Service](../digital-platform-api/campaign-service.md) to retrieve IDs.

**Operator**: `<` , `>` , or `=`

**Value**: `0` indicates that the user has never seen an impression for this object; a positive integer indicates that frequency information is available.

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike recency, frequency data is never null. If a user has never seen an impression for this object, frequency is `0`.

**Example**:

```pre
if line_item[15].frequency > 0:
2
elif campaign[20].frequency > 0:
1.5
elif campaign[23].frequency > 0:
1
else:
0.1
```

#### Lifetime frequency

Evaluate impressions based on the number of ads seen by a user over the lifetime of an advertiser, line item, or campaign.  

**Keyword**: `lifetime_frequency`

**Attribute**: `OBJECT[ID].` where `OBJECT` is `advertiser`, `line_item`, or `campaign`, or `creative`, and `ID` is the object ID. Use the [Advertiser Service](../digital-platform-api/advertiser-service.md), [Line Item Service](../digital-platform-api/line-item-service.md), or [Campaign Service](../digital-platform-api/campaign-service.md) to retrieve IDs.

**Operator**: `=<`, `<=`, `presence/absence`, `in`, `comparison`, `not`, and `range`.

**Value**: Positive integer representing the number of ads seen by a user over the lifetime of the object. `0` indicates no frequency information is available (the user has never seen this object).

**Example**:

```pre
if campaign[20].lifetime_frequency < 2:
5
elif advertiser[12].lifetime_frequency < 10:
4
elif advertiser[12].lifetime_frequency < 20:
2
else:
0.1
```

#### Daily frequency

Evaluate impressions based on the number of impressions seen by a user on the current day. This can be determined for an advertiser, line item, or campaign.  

**Keyword**: `day_frequency`

**Attribute**: `OBJECT[ID].` where `OBJECT` is `advertiser`, `line_item`, or `campaign`, and `ID` is the object ID. Use the [Advertiser Service](../digital-platform-api/advertiser-service.md), [Line Item Service](../digital-platform-api/line-item-service.md), or [Campaign Service](../digital-platform-api/campaign-service.md) to retrieve IDs.

**Operator**: `=<`, `<=`, `presence/absence`, `in`, `comparison`, `not`, and `range`.

**Value**: Positive integer representing the number of ads seen by a user on the current day. `0` indicates no frequency information is available (the user has not seen this object on the current day).

**Example**:

```pre
if campaign[20].day_frequency < 2:
5
elif advertiser[12].day_frequency < 10:
4
elif advertiser[12].day_frequency < 20:
2
else:
0.1
```

#### Recency presence/absence and data

Evaluates whether recency data is available for a user, and, if available, the number of minutes since a user has seen an ad. This can
be determined for a user for all ads under an advertiser, line item, or campaign.

**Keyword**: `recency`

**Attribute**: `OBJECT[ID].` where `OBJECT` is `advertiser`, `line_item`, or `campaign`, and `ID` is the object ID. Use the [Advertiser Service](../digital-platform-api/advertiser-service.md), [Line Item Service](../digital-platform-api/line-item-service.md), or [Campaign Service](../digital-platform-api/campaign-service.md) to retrieve IDs.

**Operator**: `=<`, `<=`, `presence/absence`, `in`, `comparison`, `not`, and `range`.

**Value**: A positive integer indicating the number of minutes since a user has seen an impression, rounded down. 59 seconds will evaluate to `0`, 61 seconds will evaluate to 1. `0` means the impression was seen very recently. `Null` means no recency data is available (the user has not seen this impression before).

**Example**:

```pre
if not advertiser.recency:
0.1
elif advertiser[3].recency > 60:
1
else:
0.2
```

### Examples of compound feature syntax using multiple attributes

#### Example of multiple segment attributes

``` pre
# This tree determines a bid price as follows:
# 1. If the user is in segment 3 and has a value greater than 1 or has been in the segment for 5 minutes, bid $1.
# 2. Otherwise, bid $2.
if any segment[3].value > 1, segment[3].age = 5:
    1.0
else:
    2.0  
```

#### Example of recency/frequency syntax with multiple attributes

``` pre
# This tree determines a bid price as follows:
# 1. If there's no recency data for this user related to ads in line item 3, bid $1.
# 2. If the user has seen an ad in line item 3 more than 5 minutes ago and the user has seen an ad in campaign 2 less than four times today, bid $3.
#3. If the user has seen an ad in line item 1 more than 5 times ever or more than 4 times today, or if the user has seen an ad in advertiser 2 more than 4 times today, bid $0.50.
#4. Otherwise, bid nothing.
