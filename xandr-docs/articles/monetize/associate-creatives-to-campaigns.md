# Associate Creatives to Campaigns



You can associate creatives to a single campaign or multiple campaigns
at once. This page walks you through the process.

Associate Creatives to a Single Campaign

Step 1. Select the campaign

On the <a href="explore-campaigns.md" class="xref">Campaigns</a>
screen, find the campaign to which you want to associate creatives and
click the Creatives button.

Step 2. Select the creatives

The **Associated Creatives**
dialog shows you the available and selected creatives. Click the check
mark for each creative that you want to associate to the campaign and
then click Save. To preview a
creative, click the image icon in the creative row; the creative will
appear in the **Preview Creative**
pane.



<b>Tip:</b> You can use the search field to
find a particular creative by name or ID. Also, all active and inactive
creatives are listed by default, but you can use the filter to the right
of the search field to show just active or inactive creatives.



Step 3. Save the associations

Click the Save button. On the
Campaigns screen, the
**Creatives** column is updated to
show the number of creatives associated to the campaign.

Associate Creatives to Multiple Campaigns

Step 1. Select the campaigns

On the <a href="explore-campaigns.md" class="xref">Campaigns</a>
screen, check the box for each campaign to which you want to associate
creatives and click
Actions 
\>  Associate to Creatives.

Step 2. Select the creatives

The **Bulk Associate Creatives** dialog shows you the available
creatives. Click the check mark for each creative that you want to
associate to the selected campaigns. To preview a creative, click the
image icon in the creative row; the creative will appear in the
**Preview Creative**.



<b>Tip:</b> You can use the search field to
find a particular creative by name or ID. Also, all active and inactive
creatives are listed by default, but you can use the filter to the right
of the search field to show just active or inactive creatives.





<b>Warning:</b> Bulk associating creatives
will overwrite any current creative associations for the selected
campaigns. Also note that you can associate a single creative to
multiple campaigns only if the line items for the campaigns use the same
currency.



Step 3. Save the associations

Click the Save button. On the
Campaigns screen, the
**Creatives** column is updated to
show the number of creatives associated to the campaigns.
