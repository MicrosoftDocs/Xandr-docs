## Example

### Create JSON formatted report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` `"audio_analytics_network"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the format in which the data should be returned (`csv`, `excel`, or `html`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](./report-service.md).

```
$ cat audio_analytics_network 
{
   "report":{
      "report_type":"audio_analytics_network",
      "columns":[
         "seller_member_name",
         "audio_context",
         "imps",
         "clicks",
         "ctr",
         "convs_rate",
         "starts",
         "25_pcts",
         "50_pcts",
         "75_pcts",
         "completions"
      ],
      "report_interval":"last_48_hours",
      "format":"csv"
   }
```

### `POST` the request to the reporting service

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X POST -d @audio_analytics_network 'https://api.appnexus.com/report' 
{ "response":{ 
    "status":"OK", 
    "report_id":"097f59fc3ab7d02c5d60db42081d9b69" 
    } 
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service

Make a `GET` call with the report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the reporting data to a file (described in the next step).

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=097f59fc3ab7d02c5d60db42081d9b69' 
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report":{
         "name":null,
         "created_on":"2021-05-25 19:19:53",
         "json_request":"{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"audio_analytics_network\",\"columns\":[\"hour\",\"seller_member_name\",\"audio_context\", \"imps\",\"clicks\",\"ctr\",\"25_pcts\",\"50_pcts\",\"75_pcts\",\"completions\",\"convs_rate\"], \"row_per\":[\"hour\",\"seller_member_name\"], \"report_interval\":\"last_48_hours\"}}",
         "url":"report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592"
      },
      "execution_status":"ready"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and report ID in the `url` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

```
{code}$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592' > /tmp/audio_analytics_network.csv {code} 
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
