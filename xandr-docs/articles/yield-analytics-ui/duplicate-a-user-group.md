# Duplicate a User Group



If you have administrative permissions, you can duplicate a user group
to quickly set up a new group with similar permissions.

1.  On the Admin Tools menu,
    click Permissions. The Permissions
    page appears, displaying the Groups panel with a table of all
    existing user groups.
2.  Click the user group you want to duplicate. The Group: \[Group
    Name\] panel appears, where \[Group Name\] is the name of the group
    you selected.
3.  At the bottom of the page,
    click Duplicate.
4.  In the Group Summary section, type
    a name and description for the duplicate group.
5.  Add and remove users in the Users in This
    Group section as follows:
    - To add users to the group, in the list of usernames on the left,
      select each username you want to add (or
      click Select All to add all
      users). As you select users, they are highlighted in the list on
      the left and added to the list on the right.
    - To remove users from the group, in the list of usernames on the
      right, click the X for each username you want to remove (or
      click Clear All to remove all
      users). As you select to remove users, they are deleted from the
      list on the right and un-highlighted in the list on the left.
6.  Change the permissions for the duplicate group as needed in
    the Features Available In This
    Group section. Select the check boxes for the features the
    group should be able to access. Clear the check boxes for the
    features the group shouldn't be able to access. The features are
    broken up into the following
    sets: Capacity, Availability, Products, Orders, Proposals, Pricing, Reports, Scenario, Admin
    Tools, and Other.
7.  Click Save.
