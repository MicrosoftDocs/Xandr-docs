# Anatomy of the Capacity Dashboard Page

The Capacity Dashboard page is the primary view for the **Capacity** tab. It provides a snapshot of your capacity for products and product groups, as well as a tasks panel to navigate to forecasts and add adjustments. It is displayed automatically when you click the **Capacity** tab.

## The dashboard interface

The Capacity Dashboard is comprised of three widgets:

- **Impression Capacity** – Displays impression capacity for products in the specified product group for a date range.
- **Manual Adjustments & Holidays** – Displays manual forecast adjustments and holidays within the specified date range.
- **Capacity Trended** – Displays impression capacity over time for the selected product. Mouse over a green bar to view the impression capacity for the date range.

For each widget, you can:

- Click **Reset** to reset the widget.
- Click **View All** to display the full report in the **Reports** tab with the metrics already selected.

To the left of the widgets is the **Capacity Tasks** panel. This is where you can select between two options to view and adjust forecasts.

- **Adjust Manual Forecast** – Make a manual adjustment to a product's forecast.
- **Adjust Seasonal Forecast** – Make a seasonal adjustment to your network's seasonal products.

Below the Capacity Tasks panel is the Processing Summary panel. This indicates when the capacity forecast was last updated.
