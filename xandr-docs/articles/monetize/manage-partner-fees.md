# Manage Partner Fees



You must have
<a href="getting-started-with-roles.md" class="xref">network level
access</a> to perform this task.

The Partner Fees page allows you to create, view, modify, and delete
fees. You can see which advertisers a fee is eligible for and which line
items it has been applied to.

View Fee Details

1.  Go to the Fees screen
    (Advertisers
    \>  Fees or hover
    over your member name in the upper-right corner of the menu bar and
    click Fees). The
    Fees table lists basic fee
    information, including vendor, type, value, calculation method,
    which advertisers the fee is eligible for, and whether the fee is
    required for all the advertiser's line items.
2.  For additional details, click on the fee. The Fee Details pane
    includes a longer fee description, supply type, the line items
    associated with the fee and their status (upcoming, in progress, or
    completed), and the history of the fee's creation and updates.

Modify a Fee

On the Partner Fee page or
the Partner Fee details pane,
click Edit (the pencil icon). You can
modify:

- Fee vendors
- <a href="fee-type.md" class="xref">Fee Type</a>
- How a fee is
  <a href="fee-calculations.md" class="xref">calculated</a>
- Whether a fee is required for all of an advertiser's line items
- The advertisers for which a fee is eligible

Delete a Fee

You cannot delete a partner fee that is associated with a line item.

1.  Go to the Fees screen
    (Advertisers
    \>  Fees or hover
    over your member name in the upper-right corner of the menu bar and
    click Fees).
2.  Select the partner fee, then select
    Actions
     \>  Delete.
