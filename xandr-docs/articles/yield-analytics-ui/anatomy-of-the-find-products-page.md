# Anatomy of the Find Products Page



The Find Products page on
the Products tab shows a searchable
list of products across your network.

**About the Find Products Interface**

The Find Products page consists of two main panels:

- <figure class="fig fignone">
  <p>Product list – This panel on the left side of the page shows a list
  of the products across your network with a summary of their performance
  for a specific time period. The metrics in this panel include
  impressions capacity, consumed impressions, available impressions,
  sell-through rate, and CPM based on the product's rate card. By default,
  the list is filtered to show active rate card products and performance
  for the current month.<br />
   You can click  in any product's row to expand it and see high-level
  product details.<br />
   You can click the link in the <span
  class="keyword wintitle">Product column for any product to view
  the product's full details. You can click in any product's row to
  display a drop-down list from which you can choose to analyze
  overlapping products, edit the product's details, or add the product to
  a scenario.<br />
  <br />
  </p>
  </figure>

- Filter panel – In this panel on the left side of the page, you can
  define the time period for the performance metrics in the product
  list. You can apply filters to narrow the list of products by product
  group, product type, parent product, overlapping products, when the
  product was created, and/or product status.

Above the product list is a toolbar. This includes a search bar where
you can enter search terms to find specific products, change the number
of product rows displayed on a page, and scroll through additional
pages. You can also export the product list to an Excel spreadsheet
(XLS) or comma-separated values (CSV) file.
