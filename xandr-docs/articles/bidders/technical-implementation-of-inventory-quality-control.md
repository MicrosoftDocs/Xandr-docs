# Inventory quality control implementation

Xandr's inventory solution allows branded advertisers to buy through our platform and proactively protect their brand. Xandr has built flexible inventory quality options to allow you to choose how to protect your brand. We empower you to choose how you interpret brand quality. We have built many options for targeting inventory while protecting your brand; you are empowered to decide how you think about inventory quality and your inventory selection.

## Implementation

- **Xandr reviewed inventory**: If you want to ensure that your ads are running on websites that meet Xandr's high-quality standards and are categorized correctly Xandr has a human audit team that has reviewed the top 3,000 domains by volume that run through our platform.
- **Work with only the sellers you trust**: If you want to expand your reach beyond platform-reviewed inventory, you can do this on a seller-by-seller basis. You have relationships with other networks and we allow you to buy from these partners and trust their category and sensitive attribute settings in the platform UI. These supply partners know their inventory well.
- **Choose what you consider a "Sensitive Attribute"**: We have labeled all platform reviewed sites with any applicable sensitive attributes and sellers have labeled their inventory, for example: political, user-generated content, moderated forums, etc. You decide what types of sites you find appropriate or inappropriate for your campaigns.
- **Content category targeting:** Xandr has set content categories for all reviewed domains and sellers have categorized their own inventory. You can choose to target by content and how much you trust each seller's categorizations.

For more details on filtering by inventory, see the [Bidder Service](bidder-service.md) and the [Enhanced Bidder Profiles](enhanced-bidder-profiles.md).
