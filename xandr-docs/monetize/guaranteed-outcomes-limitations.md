# Guaranteed outcomes limitations

Buying and selling guaranteed outcomes has the following limitations:

- Guaranteed Outcomes is only available using the Augmented Line Item (ALI)
- Guaranteed Outcomes is only available when buying Open Exchange and Deal inventory.
- Outcome-based bids are not accepted when clearing directly with a third-party seller, or when buying managed inventory.

You can, however, guarantee ad delivery for managed inventory using managed vCPM. For more information, see "Set Revenue Type" in the [Create a Guaranteed Delivery Line Item](create-a-guaranteed-delivery-line-item.md) documentation.
