# Microsoft Monetize - Working with insertion orders

Insertion orders allow you to easily manage collections of line items that may share a common budget, time span, and business terms. Insertion orders are a standard part of the [Object Hierarchy](object-hierarchy.md). An insertion order can contain one or more line items. For example, you may want to set a common budget and billing periods for several line items, but have each line item target a different region or buy different types of media.

<!-- Note that there are two types of insertion orders (for more information, see [Create an Insertion Order](create-an-insertion-order.md)):

- **Legacy** - Legacy insertion order required for legacy guaranteed and non-guaranteed line items.
- **Seamless** - Seamless insertion order compatible with augmented line items (ALI), guaranteed delivery augmented line items (GDALI), and programmatic guaranteed line items (PGLI). -->

Some useful procedures when creating and working with insertion orders here:

- **[Create an Insertion Order](create-an-insertion-order.md)** - Set up an insertion order (formerly "seamless insertion order") in Microsoft Monetize.
- **[Explore Insertion Orders](explore-insertion-orders.md)** - View essential metrics about insertion orders under a specific advertiser, get quick access to each insertion order's details and child line items, and use bulk editing and reporting options.
- **[View Insertion Order Details](view-insertion-order-details.md)** - View the settings and essential metrics for a specific insertion order, analyze visualizations of the insertion order's performance, get quick access to the insertion order's child objects, and more.
- **[Update Insertion Orders](update-insertion-orders.md)** - Update the details of an insertion order in Microsoft Monetize.
- **[Reporting on Insertion Orders](explore-insertion-orders.md)** - Initiate an advertiser analytics report for one or more insertion orders.
- **[Improve Performance with Visual Success](improve-performance-with-visual-success.md)** - View Visual Success data for insertion orders and use it to troubleshoot.
<!-- - **[Create a Legacy Insertion Order](create-a-legacy-insertion-order.md)** - Set up an old-style insertion order in Microsoft Monetize. Legacy insertion orders do not use billing periods, can't be used with the recommended augmented line item, and are no longer the best practice.
- **[View Legacy Insertion Order Details](view-legacy-insertion-order-details.md)** - View the settings and essential
  metrics for a specific legacy insertion order, analyze visualizations of the insertion order's performance, get quick access to the insertion order's child objects, and more. -->
