Once a bidder receives a [Click Request](click-request.md), it can write data to the bidder's reserved segment of the AppNexus data store through a ***click response***. This data will then be passed into the `userdata_json` field of any future [Bid Requests](bid-request.md).

## Implementation

**Specs**

| Field | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `userdata_js` | string | Javascript string to execute updating the user's `userdata_json` on a future [Bid Request](bid-request.md). |
| `segment_actions` | array | List of segments to modify for the user. |

## Example pixel response

This example will call the hypothetical `setZip` function on the user, add segment `1234` with a `60` minute expiration, and remove segment code `"abcd"` from the user.

``` 
{
    "click_response": {
        "userdata_js": "setZip('12345')",
        "segment_actions": [{"action": "add", "id":1234, "expires_min": 60},{"action": "remove", "code":"abcd","member_id":567}],
    }
}
```
