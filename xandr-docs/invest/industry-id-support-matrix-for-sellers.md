> [!NOTE]
> *Full support (SSP + DSP support): The ID is supported in both Microsoft Monetize and Microsoft Invest. This means Microsoft Invest buyers can use the ID for audience segments, frequency and recency caps, and attribution.
>
> **Passthrough (SSP support Only): The ID is only supported in Microsoft Monetize. This means that the identifier for frequency/recency capping, segments, and attribution is not used, but the ID to third-party Bidders/DSPs that may support these identifiers is passed.
