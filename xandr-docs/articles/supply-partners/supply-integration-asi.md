> [!WARNING]
> We have disabled the Supply Integration (ASI) protocolÂ (formerly AppNexus Supply Integration) for server-side supply integrations beginning on October 1st, 2017. We strongly encourage that you migrate your supply to the [OpenRTB protocol](openrtb-specs.md). Everything in this section is legacy content.
