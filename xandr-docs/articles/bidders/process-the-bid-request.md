# Process the Bid Request



When you simulate traffic to a TinyTag for which your bidder is eligible
to bid, a <a
href="outgoing-bid-request-to-bidders.md"
class="xref" target="_blank">Bid Request</a> will be sent to your
bidder. This request includes a significant amount of information about
the impression. Sample bid requests for OpenRTB and
Xandr's bidding protocol are shown below. For a
more detailed description of the various fields,
seeÂ <a href="https://docs.xandr.com/csh?context=107315343" class="xref"
target="_blank">Bid Request</a>.

The Bid Request is sent with header information, such as the IP address
and debug information. The JSON for the request itself includes details
about the members for which the auction should be evaluated by the
bidder; the tag(s) for the auction, including details about each tag;
and information about the auction, including the user ID, the region
from which the impression originated, and other information.

Once your bidder has received this first bid request, you can trust that
the initial sandbox setup is working properly.
