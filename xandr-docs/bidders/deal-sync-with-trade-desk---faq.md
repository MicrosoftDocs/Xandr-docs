# Bidders - Deal sync with Trade Desk - FAQ

> [!NOTE]
> This product is currently in **Beta** stage and has been enabled for selected sellers who have chosen to participate in the beta testing. If you would like to test out this product, reach out to your Xandr account representative.

## How do I know if a deal successfully uploaded to Trade Desk systems?

You can confirm this with the Trade Desk buyer by asking if they can see the deal in the negotiations page of the Trade Desk UI.

## How do I know if a buyer accepted the deal in the Trade Desk UI?

Ask the Trade Desk buyer to confirm they have accepted the deal in the Trade Desk UI. We are working to display the Trade Desk buyer acceptance status in  and plan to release the feature in future iterations of this product.

## What deal information is uploaded to Trade Desk systems via API?

The following details are shared with Trade Desk APIs:

| - Deal Name | - Deal Type |- Currency  |
|---|---|---|
| **- Buyer Seat ID** | **- Deal Auction Type** | **- Floor Price/Ask Price** |
| **- Seller Name** | **- Start Date** | **- Allowed Media Types** |
| **- Deal ID**| **- End Date** | **- Allowed Creative Sizes** |

## What will happen to existing Trade Desk deals that were created before enablement of deal sync?

Changes to existing deals created prior to enablement of Trade Desk deal sync will not automatically be uploaded to Trade Desk APIs. You will need to work with the buyer to manually update the deal objects in the Trade Desk UI, per the existing workflow. We have no plans to support the sync of deals created prior to a seller's enablement of deal sync with Trade Desk.

## Were updates to existing Trade Desk deals that were created before deal sync enabled automatically?

No, deals created prior to the enablement of Trade Desk deal sync on your account will not automatically update. You will need to work with the Trade Desk buyer to manually update the deal in the Trade Desk UI.

## If I created a deal with Trade Desk post enablement of deal sync and then updated the deal details, will they automatically update in Trade Desk systems?

Yes, deals created post Trade Desk deal sync enablement will have automatic deal updates. Changes you make to updatable fields (for example, start date, end date, price) will be automatically uploaded to Trade Desk systems. Once the changes are uploaded, this will trigger a change to the buyer status to "pending". You will need to ask the Trade Desk buyer to re-accept the deal in the Trade Desk UI.

## What are things I cannot change with Trade Desk deals once they are created?

The following fields cannot be changed in Trade Desk systems after a deal is uploaded:

- Buyers (cannot be removed, can add additional buyers)
- Deal Type
- Seller Member ID
- Seller Member Name

## Can I change a buyer for a deal once it has been uploaded to Trade Desk systems?

Publishers cannot remove the primary buyer from a deal once it has been uploaded to Trade Desk systems. You can check which buyer is designated the primary buyer by pulling the buyer-deal-sync object in the API or Database. If your account is enabled for multi-buyer deals, you can add additional buyer seat IDs to an existing deal.

## Can I create a deal for multiple media types?

While multi-format deals are supported in Monetize UI, Trade Desk does require that each deal have a declared media type. If your deal allows for multiple media types, Xandr will only upload one of the media types as the allowed creative format for the deal.

The order of priority will be:

1. banner
1. video
1. native
1. audio

Programmatic Guaranteed Deals cannot be multi-media type. One media type must be declared in all PG deals with Trade Desk.

## If a Trade Desk buyer manually creates a deal first in Trade Desk UI using the deal ID, and then the deal with the same deal ID gets uploaded to Trade Desk via the deal sync process, how will Trade Desk systems handle it?

If a Trade Desk buyer manually creates the deal in the Trade Desk UI before a deal is uploaded via their proposal API, this will cause
issues. Once a deal has been created in the manual workflow, it will not be able to sync properly via the deal sync process. As such, it is important to ensure that buyers do not create this deal manually and should wait for the deal to upload via the API integration.

## When I create a PG deal, do the Ask Price and impression budget numbers have to be accurate?

Yes, the "Spend" and "Impression Target" must be the same as the contracted numbers agreed with the buyer. These two numbers will be
pushed into Trade Desk systems and buyers won't be able to update them. Any changes to these two values will trigger re-acceptance of the deal.

## What should publishers tell buyers about how to accept a synced deal in the Trade Desk UI?

Publishers should guide the buyers through the following steps:

1. Select **Inventory** from the **Libraries** drop-down in the header, and then select the **Proposals** tab.
1. Once on that page they can sort by **Pending Approval** if they need to filter to only those proposals (It should automatically sort
   based on importance so that shouldn’t be necessary).
1. In that screen, the buyer should be able to see the deal and accept it.

## What are some ways for Trade Desk buyers to find the deal in the Trade Desk UI so they can accept it?

Trade Desk buyers may follow below steps to find and accept the deal:

1. Select **Inventory** from the **Libraries** drop-down in the header, and then select the **Proposals** tab.
1. Once on that page, you can sort by **Pending Approval** if you need to filter to only those proposals (it should automatically sort based on importance so this shouldn’t be necessary).

## Can a publisher pick and chose which Trade Desk buyers to automatically sync deals with?

That feature isn't supported. Deal sync with Trade Desk is designed to automate deal sync for ALL Trade Desk buyers as the
design of the final state of this product is to enable all sellers in the Xandr marketplace.

## I created a deal with Trade Desk member 1088, why did it not sync with Trade Desk systems?

Deals created with Trade Desk Xandr members are not supported in deal sync with Trade Desk as Trade Desk APIs require
the Trade Desk partner ID declared in the deal. Xandr is unable to determine which partner IDs to associate with a member ID deal.
