# Prebid Server Premium Health Analytics

The Prebid Server Premium (PSP) Health Analytics Report allows users to analyze data related to bid requests and transactions with their configured Demand Partners. This is most useful in troubleshooting known issues and proactively identifying optimization opportunities.

> [!NOTE]
> The dashboard is based on **sample data multiplied to estimate the full volume of PSP activity**. It is not intended to be used for delivery and revenue reporting. The [Prebid Server Premium Seller Analytics Report](../monetize/prebid-server-premium-seller-analytics.md) and other [Microsoft Monetize reports](../monetize/reporting-guide.md) should be used for those purposes.

## Time frame

The `report_interval` field in the JSON request can be set to one of the following:

- last_hour
- last_24_hours
- last_48_hours
- today
- yesterday
- last_2_days
- last_7_days
- last_14_days
- last_30_days
- month_to_date
- last_month
- month_to_yesterday
- quarter_to_date
- lifetime

The `time_granularity` of the data is hourly. For instructions on retrieving a report, see the [Report Service](report-service.md) or the [examples](#examples) below.

## Error types

| Code | Error | Description | Remedy |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 0 | NONE | No error. | None needed. |
| 1 | INTERNAL | There is a server-side error from the Demand Partner, such as a 400 status code. | The Seller should work with Xandr to collect a specific example code to share with the Demand Partner for investigation. |
| 2 | TIMEOUT | The Demand Partner did not respond within the timeout limit. | Either increase timeout settings to allow for a longer response time or contact the Demand Partner to inform them of the restriction. For more information on timeouts, see [Add or Edit PSP Global Settings](../monetize/add-or-edit-psp-global-settings.md). |
| 3 | CLIENT | The Demand Partner's Prebid Server adapter generated an error. | For significant quantities of this error type, the Seller should contact Xandr support to diagnose issues by looking at the internal Xandr logs. An example of this error could be that video supply has been sent to an adapter that does not support it. |
| 4 | PARSE | The Demand Partner has formatted the bid response incorrectly. | The Seller should work with Xandr and the Demand Partner to determine and resolve the specific formatting issue. |
| 21 | NO_BID_PRICE | No price received from the Demand Partner. | The Seller should notify the Demand Partner of the issue. |
| 22 | NO_CREATIVE_ID | No creative ID received from the Demand Partner. | The Seller should notify the Demand Partner of the issue. |
| 23 | NEC_ERROR | The bid was rejected during the Xandr auction process. | The bid was successfully received from the Demand Partner, but the bid was rejected within the Xandr auction. The Seller can use the Seller Bid Error report to diagnose specific rejections occurring on their supply. |
| 24 | CREATIVE_WRONG_SIZE | The Demand Partner is bidding with a creative size that doesn't match the tag size. | The Seller should review the creative size and notify the Demand Partner regarding the mismatch. |
| 70 | MEMBER_NOT_ELIGIBLE | The Seller's settings are blocking the Buyer's member from participating in the auction. | The Seller should notify the Buyer that they are currently blocked from bidding. |
| 84 | CATEGORY_REQ_ALLOWLIST | The category of the creative is sensitive and requires addition to the allowlist. | The Seller should work with the Buyer to determine if the creative warrants addition to the allowlist. |
| 132 | DYN_CREATIVE_INCOMPATIBLE_TYPE | Dynamic ad-markup bidding is not supported for certain PSP Demand Partners that require client-side rendering when a Seller doesn't support it. | The Seller should correct their setup to align with client-side rendering requirements, on both supply and PSP sides. |
| 150 | SELLER_MEMBER_NO_CONTRACT | The Seller's contract isn't set up properly. | The Seller should work with Xandr to remedy the contract issue. |

## Examples

### Create JSON formatted report request

The JSON file should include the `report_type` of `"psp_health_analytics"`, as well as the columns (dimensions and metrics) and `report_interval` that you want to retrieve. You can also filter for specific dimensions, define granularity (`year`, `month`, `day`), and specify the `"format"` in which the data should be returned (`"csv"`, `"excel"`, or `"html"`). For a full explanation of fields that can be included in the JSON file, see the [Report Service](report-service.md).

```
$ cat psp_health_analytics
   {"report": 
    {
        "format": "csv",
        "report_interval": "yesterday",
        "columns": ["hour", "publisher_id","site_id","header_bidding_demand_partner", "imps", "seller_revenue", "view_rate"],
        "report_type": "psp_health_analytics"
    }
}
```

### `POST` the request to the [Report service](report-service.md)

`POST` the JSON request to get back a report ID.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X post -d @psp_health_analytics "https://api.appnexus.com/report"
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"97a181df6d77a8f3cd5a45eff4ea3dab"
   }
}
```

### `GET` the report status from the Report service

Make a `GET` call with the report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=97a181df6d77a8f3cd5a45eff4ea3dab'
{
    "response": {
        "status": "OK",
        "report": {
            "name": null,
            "created_on": "2014-11-19 21:57:00",
            "json_request": "{\"report\":{\"format\":\"csv\",\"report_interval\":\"yesterday\",\"row_per\":[\"publisher_id\"],\"columns\":[\"hour\", \"publisher_id\",\"site_id\",\"header_bidding_demand_partner\",\"imps\",\"seller_revenue\", \"view_rate\"],\"report_type\":\"psp_health_analytics\"
            "url": "report-download?id=97a181df6d77a8f3cd5a45eff4ea3dab"
        },
        "execution_status": "ready"
    }
}
```

### `GET` the report data from the Report Download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and report ID in the `url` field of the response to your previous `GET` call. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the file format that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!NOTE]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=97a181df6d77a8f3cd5a45eff4ea3dab' > /tmp/psp_health_analytics.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
