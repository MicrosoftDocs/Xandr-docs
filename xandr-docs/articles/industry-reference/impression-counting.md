# Impression Counting



There are several different counting methodologies in use in the ad tech
industry today. Different counting methodologies have varying levels of
strictness, with the least strict methods giving credit for impressions
with less evidence that they have actually reached users and resulted in
valid impressions, and the most strict methods requiring much more
certainty before counting an impression as valid.



## Display and Mobile

The
<a href="https://www.iab.com/" class="xref" target="_blank">Interactive
Advertising Bureau (IAB)</a> and the
<a href="http://mediaratingcouncil.org/" class="xref"
target="_blank">Media Ratings Council (MRC)</a> both recommended
measuring desktop and mobile display impressions on a “count on begin to
render” basis. The count on begin to render measurement standard means
that a buyer’s ad must load and begin to render before an impression is
counted as valid. Using this measurement standard brings impression
counting methodology closer to counting the actual opportunity for an ad
to be seen by a user.



This standard is useful for two key reasons:

- It aligns mobile and desktop guidelines with video, which already uses
  a begin-to-render methodology, and thus standardizes counting
  measurements in general.
- It better aligns impression measurement with the counting model in
  place for viewable impressions, which provides an avenue to more
  cohesive cross-platform measurement for both publishers and buyers. 







## Viewable Impressions

For specific information on the standards applied to the counting of
viewable impressions, see

Viewability</a>.





## Video Impressions

For video ads, an impression is counted when the first frame of the
video is loaded. Video reporting often also measures the duration (e.g.,
first quartile, etc.) of video play.  For general information on video
concepts, see <a href="introduction-to-video-inventory-and-formats.html"
