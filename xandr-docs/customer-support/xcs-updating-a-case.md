# Updating a case

Log in to the [Customer Support Portal](https://help.xandr.com) to access your full case history, knowledge base articles, or request support.

You can use the Customer Support Portal to view all your cases and all the cases on which you've been copied, to close or reopen cases, and to add comments or attachments.

## View a case

To view an existing case, you can click the case link in the email confirmation, or navigate to the case using the tabs on the portal home
page.

- **My Cases** - Displays all your open cases.
- **CC Cases** - Displays the cases on which you're copied.
- **Closed Cases** - Displays all your closed cases.

When you click one of the case tabs, a list of matching cases appears, sorted by the date opened in ascending order. The support category,
subject, status, and date opened is displayed for each case. Click on the case to view the complete case details, including comments and
attachments.

## Add a comment

Go to the case in the portal, type your comment in the comment box, and click **Comment**. The new comment appears in the case message thread, and you (and any addresses you have included as cc email addresses) will receive an email confirmation of the comment.

## Add an attachment

Go to the case in the portal, and click **Upload Files** to select your attachment or drag and drop them into that area. After the file has been added, refresh the page for the attachment to appear in the attachment list in the right column.

 :::image type="content" source="media/xcs-case-edit-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Attachment screen.":::

## Edit an open case

Go to any open case view (My Cases, CC Cases) in the portal, and click the **down-arrow** to the right. The case edit view will appear, where you can make the updates and add/remove cc'ed emails. Once done, click **Save**.

 <!---:::image type="content" source="media/xcs-k.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Open case view.":::--->
 :::image type="content" source="media/xcs-case-edit-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Open case view.":::

## Close an open case

Go to the case in the portal and click **Close Case**.

 <!---:::image type="content" source="media/xcs-l.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Close case view.":::--->
 :::image type="content" source="media/xcs-case-edit-4.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Close case view.":::

The status in the case header changes to "Closed" and the button changes to read **Re-Open Case**.

## Re-open a closed case

Go to the case in the portal and click **Re-Open Case** in the right column.

 <!---:::image type="content" source="media/xcs-m.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Re-Open case view.":::--->
 :::image type="content" source="media/xcs-case-edit-5.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Re-Open case view.":::

The status in the case header changes to "Open" and the button changes to read **Close Case**. It's a good idea to add a comment explaining why you're re-opening the case.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you comment on a closed case, it will be re-opened automatically.
