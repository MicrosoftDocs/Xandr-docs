# Native Assembly



By using Native Assembly, publishers can take the guesswork and manual
development out of building flawless native experiences. Publishers
don't have to worry about whether or not they're keeping to industry
standards since Native Assembly validates all native creative assets
against IAB's standards. Monetize Ad Server and
third-party ad server publishers can both use Native Assembly.

## Native Assembly for Monetize Ad Server Publishers

<div id="ID-00001673__p_78b2ae4d-c253-4fb7-86dc-10d898a27ccc" >

Monetize Ad Server publishers can use Native
Assembly on the client side whereXandr's seller
tag (AST) and mobile SDKs for Android and iOS can be leveraged. With
Native Assembly, Monetize Ad Server publishers
can:

- access a gallery of high impact templates and personalize them using
  HTML, CSS, and/or Javascript.
- use custom native assets to enhance their users' experience.
- set custom price floors for their main image and video assets.

## Native Assembly for Third-Party Ad Server Publishers

<div id="ID-00001673__p_c351ed99-ac1f-46b1-8881-6fe40195198a" >

Third-party ad server publishers can use Native Assembly on the server
side. Since third-party ad server publishers do not have access to
Xandr's seller tag (AST) and mobile SDKs for
Android and iOS, their Native Assembly renderers are applied on the
server side. With Native Assembly, third-party ad server publishers can:

- expose native inventory to buyers.
- render native inventory that matches their asset specifications to
  create native assemblies.
