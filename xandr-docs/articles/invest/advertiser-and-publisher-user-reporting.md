# Microsoft Invest - Advertiser User reporting

If you have created separate [user login](managing-user-logins-and-permissions.md) for your advertisers, they will be able to run reports from their perspective. These advertiser users have a limited set of metrics, filters, and dimensions available to them. This allows you to give your clients access to reporting while protecting your proprietary business data.

For instructions on how to give advertiser users access to reporting, see [Create a User](create-a-user.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Conversion-related data in reports is processed asynchronously. As a result, reports are available more quickly, while some conversion-related data is still being processed in the background. For more information, see [Availability of Reporting Data](availability-of-reporting-data.md).
>
> The **Metrics** are shown from the advertiser's perspective, so the **Revenue** field displays the advertiser's revenue (not the Member's).
