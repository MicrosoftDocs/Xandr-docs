# Digital Platform API - Domain list service

> [!NOTE]
> Going forward, "allowlist" and "blocklist" terminology will be followed for our APIs. This is a part of an ongoing effort to evaluate our current terminology usage and usher in more inclusive terminology for Xandr platforms.

The Domain List service lets you define a list of domains that can be included or excluded from a campaign's targeting profile. Domain lists in targeting profiles are used to place domains with similar characteristics in groups that you can use to easily include or exclude domains from campaign targeting. They're generally used as *allowlists* or *blocklists.* Allowlists contain domains that you want to include in your campaign targeting, and blocklists contain domains that you want to exclude. (See `domain_list_targets` and `domain_list_action` in the [Profile Service](./profile-service.md) to see how to include these lists in your profiles).
