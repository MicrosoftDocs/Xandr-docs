For usage instructions, see the [example](#example) below. Note that this report requires that a publisher ID be specified as part of the URL, for example:

```
https://api.appnexus.com/report?publisher_id=PUBLISHER_ID
```

## Time frame

The `report_interval` field can be set to one of the following:

- current_hour
- last_hour
- today
- yesterday
- last_48_hours
- last_2_days
- last_7_days
- last_30_days
- month_to_date
- month_to_yesterday
- quarter_to_date
- last_month
- lifetime

**Data retention period**

Data retention period for the report is 428 days.

> [!NOTE]

### Create JSON formatted report request

```
{code}$ cat network_publisher_analytics
{
    "report":
    {
        "report_type":"network_publisher_analytics",
        "columns":[
            "hour",
            "buyer_member_id",
            "inventory_source",
            "gender",
            "imps_total",
            "imps_sold",
            "imps_default",
            "clicks",
            "total_convs",
            "ctr",
            "convs_rate"
        ],
        "row_per":[
            "hour",
            "buyer_member_id",
            "inventory_source_id",
            "gender"
        ],
        "report_interval":"last_48_hours",
        "format":"csv"
    }
}
{code}
```

### `POST` the request to the reporting service

```
{code}$ curl -b cookies -c cookies -X post -d @network_publisher_analytics "https://api.appnexus.com/report?publisher_id=4642"
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report_id":"f4ebb93755dd01dde4fc157f86198ea9"
   }
}
{code}
```

### `GET` the report status from the report service

Make a `GET` call with the Report ID to retrieve the status of the report. Continue making this `GET` call until the `execution_status` is `"ready"`. Then use the **report-download** service to save the report data to a file, as described in the next step.

```
{code}$ curl -b cookies -c cookies "https://api.appnexus.com/report?id=f4ebb93755dd01dde4fc157f86198ea9"
{
   "response":{
      "status":"OK",
      "report":{
         "name":null,
         "created_on":"2010-05-25 19:37:31",
         "json_request":"{\"report\":{\"report_type\":\"network_publisher_analytics\",\"columns\":[\"hour\",\"buyer_member_id\",\"inventory_source\",
            \"gender\",\"imps_total\",\"imps_sold\",\"imps_default\",\"clicks\",\"total_convs\",\"ctr\",\"convs_rate\"],
            \"row_per\":[\"hour\",\"buyer_member_id\",\"inventory_source_id\",\"gender\"],\"report_interval\":\"last_48_hours\",
            \"filters\":[{\"publisher_id\":\"4642\"}]}}",
         "url":"report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592"
      },
      "execution_status":"ready"
   }
}
{code}
```

### `GET` the report data from the report download service

To download the report data to a file, make another `GET` call with the Report ID, but this time to the **report-download** service. You can find the service and Report ID in the `url` field of the previous `GET` response. When identifying the file that you want to save to, be sure to use the file extension of the `"format"` that you specified in your initial `POST`.

> [!NOTE]
> If an error occurs during download, the response header will include an HTTP error code and message. Use `-i` or `-v` in your call to expose the response header.

```
{code}$ curl -b cookies -c cookies 'https://api.appnexus.com/report-download?id=b97897a7864dd8f34e7457226c7af592' > /tmp/network_publisher_analytics.csv
{code}
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a limit of 100,000 rows per report when you download them as XLSX and Excel file.
