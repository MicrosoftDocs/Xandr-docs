# API Getting Started



To help you get started using the API, we've provided you with several
resources. You can find an API reference, best practices, typical setup
steps, common operations for network users, and information about
concepts such as breaking changes and API usage constraints.

Before you can use any of the API services, you must have access to the
API endpoints. See  <a
href="api-onboarding-process.md"
class="xref" target="_blank">API Onboarding Process</a> for information
on gaining access. 


## Introduction

If you're new to working with REST APIs, start here to learn about how

## Email Communications

Xandr sends periodic emails that we think you'll
find useful, including Marketing Communications (event invitations,
whitepapers), Product and Technical Communications (release notes,
service updates), and Training Communications (webinars, live training
sessions). If you have a Xandr user account, you
should receive relevant communications automatically.
