  certain metrics and dimensions, this will be deprecated in favor of
  Network Analytics in the future.

  class="xref" target="_blank">Prebid Server Premium Health Analytics
  Report</a>: The primary report for optimization and troubleshooting
  which includes delivered impressions, bid requests sent, bid errors,
  and other granular information. Due to the granular nature of the
  data, this report is based on a sample of log data multiplied to

  report is 99 days.

of their demand partners, resolve any errors, and optimize away from or
remove underperforming partners.
