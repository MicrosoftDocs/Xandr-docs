# Create a product

Use the following steps to create a product:

- Click the down arrow next to the **Products** tab.
- Click **Create a Product** from the drop-down menu. The **Create Product** screen is accessed.
- Enter the **Product Name**. This is the name that you decide to give the product. It is a required field.
- Enter the **Product External Id**. This is a identifier that you may want to include to track the product on your system.
- Enter the **Target Expression**. This is accomplished by clicking the **Builder** tab.

  **Associated Product Groups** section, click the **Add to Product Groups** button. This accesses the **Product
  Group** screen.
