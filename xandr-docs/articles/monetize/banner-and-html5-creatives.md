Banner creatives are basic images or animations that can be formatted as
a JPEG, JPG, PNG, GIF, or SWF. They will typically appear above, below,
or alongside page content. Banner creatives can provide:

- More visibility: Since banner
  creatives tend to be more visually appealing than other creative
  types, they are a good way to draw customer attention and increase
  brand awareness.
- Cost savings: Banner creatives are
  easy to create with little cost involved.

HTML5 creatives are essentially mini web pages that are created using
multiple media files. HTML5 creatives can provide:

- Better user experiences: Unlike
  static banner creatives, HTML5 creatives tend to be more engaging.
  They also offer higher resolution quality and help with faster load
  times since they are small in file size.
- Optimized performance: With HTML5
  creatives, you can measure more than just CTR such as VCR.
